		<h4>Installing Eclipse</h4>
		<p>You can download Eclipse from <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse
		downloads</a>. If you are only going to use Eclipse for leJOS NXJ
		programs, you will only need standard Java development capabilities -
		you will not need a version that supports the Java Enterprise Edition
		or other languages such as C++ or Eclipse plugin development. A
		package such as "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is sufficient for
		leJOS NXJ. Make sure you download a package for your operating system.
		Note, however that for Windows, even if you are on a 64-bit system,
		you need a 32-bit version of Eclipse, for leJOS NXJ. The examples in
		this section are for Microsoft Windows, but the installation process
		is similar for other operating systems. If you are using Linux, your
		distribution may have its own Eclipse package, which you may prefer to
		use.</p>
		<p>Unzip the package you downloaded to a folder. If you extract
		all files to C:\ then your Eclipse folder will be C:\eclipse.</p>
		<p>You can start Eclipse by running eclipse.exe from your Eclipse
		folder. You may want to put a shortcut to eclipse.exe on your desktop.</p>
		<p>When you first start Eclipse, you are asked to select a
		workspace:</p>
		<img src="eclipseworkspace.jpg" />
		<p>You can leave this as the default, or you can work with
		multiple workspaces and create one just for your leJOS projects.</p>

		<p>When you click OK, the IDE will open and you will see a welcome
		screen. You can close the Welcome window and start developing leJOS
		programs.</p>

		<p>The tutorial takes you through running the samples and PC
		samples that come with leJOS and then looks at an example project that
		uses an <b>ant</b> build file. It then shows you how to create your
		own project that uses an ant build file. If you are not interested in
		this and only want to use the Eclipse plugin, skip to <a href="#7">Installing
		the Eclipse plugin</a>.</p>

		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

		<a name="2"></a>
		<h4>Importing the leJOS NXJ projects into Eclipse</h4>

		<p>You should first import the leJOS projects into your Eclipse
		workspace. The easiest way to do this is to select File &gt; Import...
		and then choose General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace. Browse
		to the folder where you installed the leJOS projects (e.g.
		C:\Users\Me\leJOSNXJProjects or C:\Documents and
		Settings\Me\leJOSNXJSettings), and select them all to import.</p>

		<p>Note that if you import the leJOS NXJ projects this way, the
		source does not get moved to the workspace, but stays in
		leJOSNXJProjects. You may prefer to copy your projects from
		leJOSNXJProjects into the Eclipse workspace and then import them by
		selecting the Eclipse workspace as the source folder. That way you
		have always got a clean copy of the leJOS NXJ projects and the Eclipse
		versions will not be uninstalled when you install a new version of
		leJOS.</p>


		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

		<a name="3"></a>
		<h4>Using the samples project</h4>

		<p>You should then see several projects in your Package Explorer
		window including samples. Try exploring the samples project. You can
		open up folders by clicking on the expand/collapse toggles next to the
		folder name, and you can open files by double-clicking on file names.
		Try expanding the "BlueStats" folder, and its "default package" folder
		and opening BlueStats.java. You should see:</p>

		<img src="eclipsesamples.jpg" />

		<p>There is a source folder within the samples project for each
		sample. Each folder contains a build.xml file which is a build file
		for the sample written using "ant". Ant is a build system specially
		designed for Java - it comes bundled with Eclipse.</p>
		<p>There are other ways of building, uploading and running leJOS
		NXJ programs, such as using the leJOS Eclipse plugin, but the ant
		build files are easy to use, so we will start with them.</p>

		<p>Ant build files have different "targets". The default target
		for the sample build.xml files is "uploadandrun". This means that if
		you run the build.xml file it will compile the Java source, link it
		with the standard leJOS classes (classes.jar) to produce a binary file
		and then upload ad run the binary file.</p>
		<p>Turn on your NXT, make sure it is connected by USB or can be
		connected to via Bluetooth. Then right-click on the build.xml and
		select "Run As" and "Ant Build":</p>

		<img src="eclipsebuild.jpg" />

		<p>You should see output like the following in the Console window:</p>

</pre>
		<p>This verbose output from the leJOS linker tells you all the
		classes and methods that have been included in your program. It is
		very useful for debugging your programs.</p>
		<p>You should see the Bluetooth statistics on your NXT LCD screen.
		You can stop the BlueStats program by pressing the ESCAPE button on
		the NXT.</p>
		<p>You can browse through the samples and try them out. Some of
		the samples need to communicate with a program on the PC - see <a
			href="#4">Using the PC samples project</a> below. Other samples need
		specific sensors attached to the NXT or a robot with specific
		characteristics - such as a steerable wheeled vehicle. See the
		comments at the start of each of the Java files to understand the
		requirements of the sample.</p>
		<p>Note that the samples project uses default package names for
		simplicity. This is not good practice for Java programming so when we
		create our own project, we will use a proper package name.</p>
		<p>Note also that the samples project contains multiple programs
		each with a main method. This is convenient for showing lots of
		examples of leJOS NXJ programming in one project, but is not best
		practice. When we create our own projects, we will have a separate
		Eclipse project for each leJOS NXJ program</p>

		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

		<a name="4"></a>
		<h4>Using the PC samples project</h4>
		<p>If you imported all the leJOS NXJ projects into your workspace,
		you should have a pcsamples project. Open it up and look at one of the
		samples such as BTSend.</p>

		<p>BTSend works with the BTReceive or NXTReceive samples.
		BTSend.java runs on the PC and BTReceive.java (or NXTReceive.java)
		runs on the NXT.</p>

		<p>There are no build files for the PC samples as they are not
		necessary. You can run BTSend.java by right-clicking on it and
		selecting, "Run as Java application", but first we need BTReceive
		running on the NXT.</p>


		<p>Go to the samples application, select the build.xml file for
		BTReceive, and run it (Run as Ant Build) to upload BTReceive to the
		NXT.</p>

		<p>Now go back to the pcsamples project and run BTSend.java.
		BTSend should now run and connect to BTReceive, send it 100 integers
		and display the values it gets back. BTReceive will then wait for
		another connection.</p>

		<p>You can use BTSend with the NXTReceive sample instead.
		NXTReceive is similar to BTReceive but it lets you choose which
		protocol and which mode you want to use to send data.</p>

		<p>You can look through the other PC samples and try them out in a
		similar way. Some of them are paired with NXT samples. Look at the
		comment at the start of the Java files. Some of them run a subset of
		the leJOS NXJ API on the PC using remote execution. AccelDemo,
		SensorTest and TachoCount are examples of this. TachoCount shows you
		how to control which NXT brick you connect to if you have multiple NXT
		bricks available.</p>

		<h4>Using the org.lejos.example project</h4>

		<p>The org.lejos.example is a good example of how to create an
		Eclipse project for leJOS that uses an ant build file.</p>

		<img src="eclipseexample.jpg" />

		<p>It is good practice to include the name of your organization in
		the project name to avoid name clashes with other projects in the work
		space. However if you are the only user of a project, this is not
		necessary.</p>

		<p>The project has a src directory that holds all the source
		packages. The example project has a single package: org.lejos.example.
		Again it is a good idea to follow the standard Java conventions for
		package names, but if you are not sharing the project with anyone, it
		is not necessary.</p>

		<p>The org.lejos.example has a single class file: HelloWorld.</p>

		<p>The project is built by the ant build file: build.xml.
		build.xml uses a properties file build.properties which has properties
		that define which version of leJOS you are using (nxj.home) and the
		name and package of your masin class.</p>

		<p>The build.xml has ant targets for linking and uploading the
		leJOS binary. The default target is uploadandrun, which compiles the
		source, links the binary, uploads the binary and runs it</p>

		<p>Try right-clicking on build.xml and selecting "Ant Build". You
		should see the verbose output from the linker in the Eclipse console
		windows and the binary will be uploaded to the NXT and run.</p>

		<p>If you want to run a different ant target, right-click on
		build.xml and select "Ant Build ...".</p>

		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

		<h4>Creating your own project</h4>

		<p>This section describes how to create a project that uses an ant
		build file. If you prefer to use the Eclipse plugin, skip to <a
			href="#7">Installing the Eclipse plugin</a> below.</p>

		<p>To create a project, select File &gt; New &gt; Java Project.
		Give the project a name, e.g. "org.me.myproject" and press Finish to
		accept all the defaults.</p>
		<p>You should now see "org.me.myproject" in the Package Explorer.</p>

		<p>You will need to add classes.jar to your project. To do this
		right-click on "org.me.myproject", select "Properties" and then "Java
		Build Path". Then select Libraries and then "Add external Jar". Browse
		for classes.jar in your NXJ installation and select it. As classes.jar
		replaces the standard Java run time library, you should remove it by
		selecting &quot;JRE System Library&quot; and clicking
		&quot;Remove&quot;. You will now see classes.jar (and not JRE System
		Library) under "Referenced Libraries" in org.me.myproject.</p>

		<p>You should use a package name for your project. We will also
		call our package "org.me.mypackage".</p>

		<p>Select the "src" folder in org.me.myproject, right-click on it
		and select New &gt; Package and type your package name.</p>

		<p>We now want to create main class.To do this, select the package
		you have just created, right-click on it and select New &gt; Class.
		Type in the class name - we will use "HelloWorld". Select the "public
		static void main(String[] args)" option. You should now have a
		HelloWorld.java program containing:</p>

		<div class="CodeBox"><pre><code>
package org.me.mypackage;

public class HelloWorld {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }
}
				    </code></pre></div>

		<p>Edit the source so it reads:</p>

		<div class="CodeBox"><pre><code>
package org.me.mypackage;

import lejos.nxt.*;

public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        Button.waitForPress();
    }
}
				    </code></pre></div>

		<p>You will now need to build your project. One way to do this is
		to use an ant build file in the same way that the org.lejos.example
		project does. To do this, select a build.xml file from
		org.lejos.example, right-click on it and select "Copy". Then go to the
		src directory, right-click on it and select "Paste". Do the same for
		build.properties</p>
		<p>Double-click on build.xml to edit it and change the name and
		description attributes. Then change the main.class property to the
		name of your class, e.g. "HelloWorld" and the "package" property to ""org.me.mypackage".</p>

		<p>You are now ready to upload and run your first leJOS NXJ
		project. This is done in the same way as for the samples: and
		org.lejos.example: by right-clicking on the build.xml file and
		selecting "Ant Build".</p>
		<p>Make sure your NXT is switched on.</p>
		<p>You should the verbose linker output in the Console window, and
		your program should be uploaded to the NXT and run. You should see
		"Hello World" on the NXT LCD screen. Press any key on the NXT to stop
		the program.</p>

		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

		<a name="7"></a>
		<h4>Installing the Eclipse plugin</h4>

		<p>An easier way to set up a project for leJOS is to use the
		Eclipse plugin.</p>
		<p>The plugin will automatically convert your projects to leJOS
		NXJ projects.</p>
		<p>To install the leJOS, click on the Help menu and select
		"Software Updates...". You should see the following screen:</p>

		<img src="eclipsesoftwareupdate.jpg" />

		<p>Select "Add Site..." and you will be prompted for the site
		name. Type "http://lejos.sourceforge.net/tools/eclipse/plugin/nxj/".</p>

		<img src="eclipselejossite.jpg" />

		<p>Click on OK and the site is added. Select the newly added site:</p>

		<img src="eclipseselectplugin.jpg" />

		<p>Click on install and Eclipse will check for dependencies and
		then prompt you to install the plugin:</p>

		<img src="eclipseinstallplugin.jpg" />

		<p>Click on "Finish" and the plugin will be installed. When it is
		finished, you will be prompted to restart Eclipse:</p>

		<img src="eclipserestart.jpg" />

		<p>Click on "Yes" and Eclipse will restart.</p>

		<p>When Eclipse has restarted, you can read the plugin help by
		select clicking on the Help menu and selecting "Help Contents and then
		"leJOS NXJ".</p>

		<img src="eclipsehelp.jpg" />

		<p>It is a good idea to read the help page to familiarize yourself
		with the plugin.</p>

		<p>To Configure the plugin for your system and preferences, click
		on the "Window" menu and select Preferences and then "leJOS NXJ".</p>

		<img src="eclipsepreferences.jpg" />

		<p>Browse to where you installed leJOS NXJ and select it as
		NXJ_HOME. Select any other options you require. It is a good idea to
		check the "Verbose" option.</p>

		<p>When you have set your preferences, click on "Apply" and then
		"OK".</p>

		<p>The plugin is now set up and ready to use.</p>

		<a name="8"></a>
		<h4>Using the Eclipse plugin</h4>

		<p>You can upload the leJOS NXJ firmware to your NXT from the
		plugin, by clicking on the "leJOS NXJ" menu item and selecting "Upload
		Firmware" or by clicking on the button on the toolbar.</p>

		<img src="eclipsefirmware.jpg" />

		<p>To create a new leJOS NXJ project using the plugin, create a
		Java project, by (for example) clicking on File and selecting "New"
		and then "Java Project". Give your project a name and accept the
		defaults for project creation.</p>

		<p>When your project has been created, right-click on it, and
		select "leJOS NXJ" and "Convert to leJOS NXJ Project".</p>

		<img src="eclipseconvert.jpg" />

		<p>This will mark your project as a leJOS NXJ project and replace
		the JRE System Library with classes.jar from your NXJ_HOME
		installation.</p>

		<p>You can now add packages and classes to your project and build
		it in the normal way for Java projects (e.g. by setting the Build
		Automatically flag).</p>

		<p>When you are ready to upload your program to the brick,
		right-click on your main program and select "Upload Program to the NXT
		Brick".</p>

		<img src="eclipseupload.jpg" />

		<p>You will see output on a leJOS NXJ Console and a progress
		screen:</p>

		<img src="eclipseprogress.jpg" />

		<p>The upload will use USB or Bluetooth depending on which option
		you set on the leJOS NXJ Preferences page. You can change this and
		other preferences whenever you want. If you selected the "Run program
		after upload" option, the program will start running on your NXT when
		it has finished uploaing.</p>

		<a name="9"></a>
		<h4>Setting up the leJOS GUI Tools</h4>
		<p>leJOS NXJ comes with a set of GUI tools that can be using for
		flashing the firmware, exploring files on the NXT, monitoring and
		debugging programs on the NXT, downloading data logs, etc. It is
		useful to be able to run these tools within Eclipse, and to do this
		you need to set them up as external tools.</p>
		<p>To create external tools click on the down array next to the
		Run External Tools Icon on the toolbar and select "External Tools
		Configuration":</p>
		<img src="eclipseexternal.jpg" />
		<p>Then select Program and click on the New Launch Configuration
		button and you should see:</p>
		<img src="eclipseconfiguration.jpg" />
		<p>Type the name of your configuration, such as NXJ Flash and
		click on Browse File System and find the bin directory of where you
		installed leJOS NXJ and select nxjflashg.bat.</p>

		<p>If you have multiple installations of leJOS you can go to the
		Environment tab and set NXJ_HOME to the one you wish to use.</p>

		<p>Other GUI tools you should set up include:</p>
		<ul class="BlueArrows">
			<li>nxjbrowse - an Explorer for NXJ files</li>
			<li>nxjconsoleviewer - GUI viewer for RConsole debug output</li>
			<li>nxjmonitor - Remote monitoring of programs running on the
			NXT</li>
			<li>nxjdataviewer - GUI tool to download data logs from NXT</li>
			<li>nxjcontrol - a GUI tool that combines the function of all of the above tool, and adds a few more functions.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You may also want to set up command line tools such as:</p>
		<ul class="BlueArrows">
			<li>nxjflash - command line firmware flash tool</li>
			<li>nxjconsole - command line viewer for RConsole debugging	output</li>
			<li>nxjsocketproxy - proxy for communicating with PC and Internet program using sockets</li>
		</ul>
