<h4>Installing Netbeans</h4>
<p> You can download Netbeans from <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Netbeans downloads</a>. 
If you are only going to use Netbeans for leJOS NXJ programs, you will only need standard Java development capabilities
- you will not need a version that supports the Java Enterprise Edition or other languages such as C++. A package such as "Java SE" is
sufficient for leJOS NXJ. </p>

<p>If you are not familiar with NetBeans, try the NetBeans quick start tutorial <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html" target="_blank">http://www.netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html</a>.</p>

<p>The next two sections are about using the samples that come with leJOS NXJ. If you want to skip this and start creating your own project, 
go to <a href="#4">Installing the Netbeans Plugin</a>.</p>

<a name="#2"></a>
<h4>Using the samples project</h4>

<p>You can open the leJOS NXJ samples project by selecting
File &gt; Open Project and browsing to the samples folder in the
location where you installed the leJOS java projects. If you used the Windows installer this will be leJOSNXJProjects in your home directory.Otherwise it will be lejos_nxj/projects.</p>

<p> There is a source folder within the samples project for
each sample. Open up the BlueStats source folder and the "default
package" that it contains and you will see the BlueStats.java sample
file and a build.xml file. The build.xml file is a build file for the
sample written using "ant". Ant is a build system specially designed
for Java - it comes bundled with Netbeans.</p>

<p> Ant build files have different "targets". The default
target for the sample build.xml files is "uploadandrun". This means
that if you run the build.xml file and select this target it will
compile the Java source, link it with the standard leJOS classes
(classes.jar) to produce a binary file and then upload ad run the
binary file.</p>

<p>Turn on your NXT, make sure it is connected by USB or
can be connected to via Bluetooth. Then right-click on the build.xml
and select "Run Target" and "uploadandrun":</p>

<img src="netbeansbuild.jpg" />

<p> You should see output like the following in the Console window:</p>

</pre>

<p>This verbose output from the leJOS linker tells you all
the classes and methods that have been included in your program. It is
very useful for debugging your programs.</p>

<p> You should see the Bluetooth statistics on your NXT LCD
screen. You can stop the BlueStats program by pressing ESCAPE on the NXT.</p>

<p> You can browse through the samples and try them out.
Some of the samples need to communicate with a program on the PC - see
"Using the PC samples project" below. Other samples need specific
sensors attached to the NXT or a robot with specific characteristics -
such as a steerable wheeled vehicle. See the comments at the start of
each of the Java files to understand the requirements of the sample.</p>

<p>Note that the samples project uses default package names
for simplicity. This is not good practice for Java programming so when
we create our own project, we will use a proper package name.</p>

<p>Note also that the samples project contains multiple
programs each with a main method. This is convenient for showing lots
of examples of leJOS NXJ programming in one project, but is not best
practice. When we create our own projects, we will have a separate
Netbeans project for each leJOS NXJ program</p>

<h4>Using the PC samples project</h4>

<p>You can open the leJOS NXJ samples project by selecting File &gt; Open Project and browsing to the samples folder in the
location where you installed the leJOS java projects.</p> 

<p>Open the BTSend folder. BTSend works with the BTReceive sample. BTSend.java runs on the PC and BTReceive.java runs on the NXT.</p>

<p> There are no build files for the PC samples as they are not necessary. You can run 
BTSend.java by right-clicking on it and selecting, "Run File" (after you have started BTReceive on the NXT).</p>
   
   <p>You can use BTSend with the NXTReceive sample instead. NXTReceive is similar to BTReceive but it lets you choose which protocol and which mode you want to use to send data.</p>
   
   <p>You can look through the other PC samples and try them out in a similar way. 
   Some of them are paired with NXT samples. Look at the comment at the start of the Java files. Some of them run a subset of the leJOS NXJ API
   on the PC using remote execution. AccelDemo, SensorTest and TachoCount are examples of this.
   TachoCount shows you how to control which NXT brick you connect to if you have multiple NXT bricks available.</p>

<h4>Installing the Netbeans Plugin</h4>
<p>It is very easy to install the Netbeans Plugin. Just Open Netbeans.In Tools &gt; Plugins, click on the Downloaded tab, and click on Add Plugins.
 Then browse to the directory where you installed the leJOS NXJ projects. In it, find NXJPlugin/build/nxjplugin.nbm .
 Click on it, and it will be installed.

<h4>Creating your own project using the Netbeans Plugin</h4>

<p>You should not try to write
code for the NXT using the standard Java Project of NetBeans.
Instead, you need a special type of project that
will use the leJOS tools to link and upload your code. The easiest way
to create a NXJ project is to use the NetBeans plugin. </p> 

<p>If instead, you wish to create your own project with a custom ant build file, open the org.lejos.example project, and look at what that does. 
It is a free form Java project. It is in fact, the template project that the Netbeans plugin uses.</p>

<p>To create a NXJ project using the plugin, select File&gt;New Project. then "Samples". In the
Projects tab, select "NXJSample" and click next.  The New Project window will open.
Type in the name you want to use, such as "myproject" and click "finish'"</p>

<p> You should now see "myproject" in the Projects tab.
 In Source Packages &gt; sample
you will see HelloWorld.java., which by
default is the Main class in your project.  Click on it to
open it in the editor.  </p>

<p>The plugin copies a build.xml file and build.properties into your
project.  You can select and run targets in build.xml just as you
did with the Samples project. Or can use the various shourcut
keys the work with standard Java projects that you learned in the
NetBeans tutorials. (Do not use the &quot;Netbeans zip&quot; target unless you know what you are doing. It makes your project the template for the Netbeans plugin, but you need to rebuild and re-install the NXJPlugin project to activate this).</p>

<p>You can rename the HelloWorld class by
selecting the name, and using the Refactor &gt; Rename.
Likewise, you can change the name of the package the same
way.   After renaming it, you might wat to change the  project name, description and the &quot;main.class&quot; property in the build.xml file. This is not strictly necessary if you are only going to use the &quot;Run File&quot; and &quot;Compile File&quot; targets but changing &quot;main.class&quot; allows you to run the targets in the build.xml file by right-clicking on it. There is a bug in the 0.85 version of the plugin which means you will also need to change the &quot;program&quot; property to your new class name (without the package name). </p>

<p>Right-click on your project, select &quot;Properties&quot; and go to &quot;Java Sources Classpath&quot;. 
You will notice that there is a relative path to classes.jar. You might want to delete this and add an external jar file 
and set it to classes.jar in your leJOS NXJ installation's lib folder.</p>

<p> To test your project, right click on the java file of your main class, and select "Run File". This should compile, link and upload your
program to the NXT and run it.</p>

<p>If you want to change the target that Run File uses, go to the Files view and edit the nbproject/ide-file-targets.xml.</p>
