				<h4>Programming Behavior with leJOS NXJ</h4>

				<p>When most people start programming
				a robot, they think of the program flow as a series of if-thens,
				which is reminiscent of structured programming (Figure 1). This
				type of programming is very easy to get started in and hardly
				requires any thought or design beforehand. A programmer can just
				sit at the computer and start typing (although a little thought before the typing may avoid a lot of grief later.)
				<br /><br /><img src="figure1.jpg" border="1" />
				<br />Fig 1  Structured programming visualized.<br />
				<br />The problem is, the code
				ends up as spaghetti code; all tangled up and difficult to expand.
				<br />The behavior control model, in contrast, requires a little more
				planning before coding begins, but the payoff is that each
				behavior is nicely encapsulated within an easy to understand
				structure. This will theoretically make your code easier to
				understand by other programmers familiar with the behavior control
				model, but more importantly it becomes very easy to add or remove
				specific behaviors from the overall structure, without negative
				repercussions to the rest of the code. It also makes it possible to
                                test and debug each behavior by itself.</p>
			
				
				The concepts of Behavior Programming as implemented in leJOS NXJ  are very simple:
			<ul>
			  <li>Only one behavior can be active and in control of the robot at any time.</li>
	          <li>Each behavior has a fixed priority.</li>
	          <li>Each behavior can determine if it should take control.</li>
	          <li>The active behavior has higher priority than any other behavior that should take control.</li>
           
			</ul>
	
		
			 <a name="2"></a>
				<h4>The Behavior API </h4>
				The Behavior API is is composed of only one interface and one class. 
				The Behavior interface defines the individual behavior classes.  
				The Behavior interface is very general and defines three public methods.  Each task that
                                the robot must perform can be defined in its own class.
				It works quite well because, even though the individual implementations of a behavior vary widely, 
				they are all treated alike.  Once all the behaviors are created, they are given to an 
				Arbitrator to regulate which behavior should be activated at any time.  
				The Arbitrator class and the Behavior interface are located the lejos.subsumption package. 
				The API for the Behavior interface is as follows.
				
				<a name="3"></a>
				
				<h5>lejos.subsumption.Behavior</h5>
                                <br></br>
		   <ul  class="BlueArrows">

			  <li> boolean takeControl()<p>
			  Returns a boolean value to indicate
				if this behavior should become active.  For example, if a touch
				sensor indicates the robot has bumped into an object, this method
				should return true. This method should return quickly, not perform
                                a long calculation.</p>
				</li>
					
			<li>
			void action()<p>
					The code in this method begins performing its task 
			        when the behavior becomes active. For example, if
				takeControl() detects the robot has collided with an object, the
				action() code could make the robot back up and turn away from the
				object.<br></br>
				 A behavior is active as long as its action() method is running,
                                 so the action() method should exit when its task is complete.
                                 Also, the action() method should exit promptly when suppress() is called.
                                 When it exits, it should leave the robot in a safe state for the next behavior.

                                 </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				 void suppress()<br></br>
					The code in the suppress() method
				should immediately terminate the code running in the action()
				method. It also should exit quickly.
			</li>
			</ul>
			
        <p>   As you can see, the three methods
            in the Behavior interface are quite simple. If a robot has three
            discrete behaviors, then the programmer will need to create three
            classes, with each class implementing the Behavior interface. Once
            these classes are complete, your code should hand the behavior
            objects off to the Arbitrator to deal with.
            </p>

            <a name="4"></a>

            <h5>lejos.subsumption.Arbitrator</h5>

            <p>The constructor is:</p>

        <ul class="BlueArrows">
        <li>public Arbitrator(Behavior[] behaviors, boolean returnWhenInactive)
                <p>Creates an Arbitrator object
                that regulates when each of the behaviors will become active.<br />Parameter: behaviors.
                 The priority of each behavior is its index in the array.  So behaviors[0] has the lowest priority.
                 </p>
                 <p>Parameter:  boolean  returnWhenInacative;
                  If <b>true</b>, the program exits when there is no behavior that wants to take control.
                   Otherwise, the program runs until shut down by pressing the Enter and Escape buttons.
                    </p><p>Parameter: an array of Behaviors</p></li>
    </ul>
				
				<p>Public Methods:</p>

				
				<ul class="BlueArrows">
					<li><p>public void start() </p><p>Starts the arbitration system.</p></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The Arbitrator class is even easier
				to understand than Behavior. When an Arbitrator object is
				instantiated, it is given an array of Behavior objects. Once it
				has these, the start() method is called and it begins arbitrating;
				deciding which behavior will become active. The Arbitrator
				calls the takeControl() method on each Behavior object, starting
				with the object with the highest index number in the array. It
				works its way down through the array, (in decreasing priority order) 
				 till it finds a behavior that wants to take control.  
				If the  priority index of this behavior is greater than that of the current active behavior, 
				 the active behavior is suppressed. 
				The action  method is then called on the behavior of this index.  
				As a result, if several  behaviors  want to take control,
				then only the highest priority behavior will become active.  (Figure 2).</p>

				<h4>Coding Behaviors</h4>
	 <p> For reliable performance of the behavior control system, it is essential that the action() method  terminates
		 promptly when suppress() is called.  One way to guarantee this is to define a boolean flag <i> suppressed </i>
		 in each behavior.
		 This variable is set to <i>true</i> by the suppress() method and tested in every loop of the action()
		  method. Of course, the first thing an action() method must do is set this flag to <i>false</i>.
		 The action() method might be quite complex, such as a separate thread for line tracking or wall following,
		 but it must be  coded to ensure prompt exit from action() when necessary.  This is the
		   <b>recommended design pattern</b>.
		   </p>
				<p>Now that we are familiar with the
				Behavior API under leJOS, let's look at a simple example using
				three behaviors. For this example, we will program some behavior
				for a simple robot with differential steering. This robot will
				drive forward as its primary low-level behavior. This activity
                                continues unless  the robot hits an object, then a high priority
                                behavior will become active to back the robot up and turn it 90 degrees.
                                There will also be a third
				behavior which we will insert into the program after the first two
				have been completed. Let's start with the first behavior.</p>
				
				<p>As we saw in the Behavior
				interface, we must implement the methods action(), suppress(), and
				takeControl(). The behavior for driving forward will take place in
				the action() method. It simply needs to make motors A and C rotate
				forward and it  exits when  the motors are no longer moving, or suppress is called.
				This behavior  remains active as long as the motors are turning. 
				The method code is:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public void action() {
    suppressed = false;  // standard first line of action
    Motor.A.forward();
    Motor.C.forward();
    while( !suppressed )
        Thread.yield(); // wait for  suppressed to be called
    Motor.A.stop(); // clean up 
    Motor.C.stop();
   }
				</code></pre>
				</div>
   
				<p>That was easy enough! Now the
				standard suppress() method will stop this action when it is called:
				</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public void suppress() {
    suppressed = true;
    }
</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>So far, so good. Now we need to
				implement a method to tell Arbitrator when this behavior should
				become active. As we outlined earlier, this robot will drive
				forward always, unless something else suppresses it, so this
				behavior should always want to take control (it's a bit of a
				control freak). The takeControl() method should return true, no
				matter what is happening. This may seem counter-intuitive, but
				rest assured that higher level behaviors will be able to cut in on
				this behavior when the need arises. The method appears as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">

				<pre><code>
public boolean takeControl() {
    return true;
    }
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>That's all it takes to define our
				first behavior to drive the robot forward. The complete code
				listing for this class is as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;
import lejos.nxt.*;

public class DriveForward  implements Behavior {

   private boolean suppressed = false;



   public boolean takeControl() {
      return true;
   }

   public void suppress() {
      suppressed = true;
   }

   public void action() {

     suppressed = false;
     Motor.A.forward();
     Motor.C.forward();
     while( !suppressed ) Thread.yield();
     Motor.A.stop(); // clean up
     Motor.C.stop();

}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				
				<p>The second behavior is a little
				more complicated than the first, but still very similar. The main
				action of this behavior is to reverse and turn when the robot
				strikes an object or detects one close by.  In this example, we would like the behavior to
				take control only when the touch sensor strikes an object, 
				or the ultrasonic sensor gets an echo from a close object. Here is the takeControl() method
				that does it: 
				</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public boolean takeControl() {
  return touch.isPressed() || sonar.getDistance() &#60; 25;
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>
				
				<p> This assumes that a TouchSensor object has been created in an instance variable called <i>touch</i>
				and a new  UltraSonicSensor object has been assigned to the variable <i>sonar</i>.</p>

				<p>For the action, we want the robot to back up
				and rotate when it detects  an object, so we will define the
				action() method as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public void action()
{
    suppressed = false;
    Motor.A.rotate(-180, true);
    Motor.C.rotate(-360, true);

    while(Motor.C.isRotating() &amp;&amp; !suppressed)
        Thread.yield();  // wait till turn is complete or suppressed is called
    if( suppressed ){
        Motor.A.stop();
        Motor.C.stop();
    }
}

				</code></pre>
				</div>
				
				<p> We use the standard suppress() method here too.</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">

				<pre><code>
public void suppress {
  suppressed = true;
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>The complete listing for this behavior is as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;

import lejos.nxt.*;

public class HitWall implements Behavior {
    public HitWall(SensorPort port )
    {
        sonar = new UltrasonicSensor( port );
    }
    private boolean suppressed = false;
    private TouchSensor touch;
    private UltrasonicSensor sonar;
    private boolean suppressed = false;

   public boolean takeControl() {
      return touch.isPressed() || sonar.getDistance() &#60; 25;
   }

   public void suppress() {
      suppressed = true;
   }


public void action() {

   // Back up  and turn

   suppressed = false;

   Motor.A.rotate(-180, true);
   Motor.C.rotate(-360, true);

   while( Motor.C.isRotating() &amp; !suppressed )
         Thread.yield();

   Motor.A.stop();
   Motor.C.stop();

  }  
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>We now have our two behaviors
				defined, and it's a simple matter to make a class with a main()
				method to get things started. All we need to do is create an array
				of our behavior objects, and instantiate and start the Arbitrator
				as shown in the following code listing:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;

public class BumperCar {
   public static void main(String [] args) {
      Behavior b1 = new DriveForward();
      Behavior b2 = new HitWall(SensorPort.S2);
      Behavior [] bArray = {b1, b2};
      Arbitrator arby = new Arbitrator(bArray);
      arby.start();
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>The above code is fairly easy to
				understand. The first two lines in the main() method create
				instances of our behaviors. The third line places them into an
				array, with the lowest priority behavior taking the lowest array
				index. The fourth line creates the Arbitrator, and the fifth line
				starts the Arbitration process. When this program is started the
				robot will scurry forwards until it bangs into an object, then it
				will retreat, rotate, and continue with its forward movement until
				the power is shut off.</p>
				
				<p>This seems like a lot of extra work
				for two simple behaviors, but now let's see how easy it is to
				insert a third behavior without altering any code in the other
				classes. This is the part that makes behavior control systems very
				appealing for robotics programming. Our third behavior could be
				just about anything. We'll have this new behavior monitor the
				battery level and play a tune when it dips below a certain level.
				Examine the completed Behavior:</p>

				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;
import lejos.nxt.*;

public class BatteryLow implements Behavior {
   private float LOW_LEVEL;
   private boolean suppressed = false; 
   private static final short [] note = {
      2349,115, 0,5, 1760,165, 0,35, 1760,28, 0,13, 1976,23,
      0,18, 1760,18, 0,23, 1568,15, 0,25, 1480,103, 0,18,
      1175,180, 0,20, 1760,18, 0,23, 1976,20, 0,20, 1760,15,
      0,25, 1568,15, 0,25, 2217,98, 0,23, 1760,88, 0,33, 1760,
      75, 0,5, 1760,20, 0,20, 1760,20, 0,20, 1976,18, 0,23,
      1760,18, 0,23, 2217,225, 0,15, 2217,218};
   
   public BatteryLow(float volts) {
      LOW_LEVEL = volts;
   }

   public boolean takeControl() {
      float voltLevel = Battery.getVoltage();
      System.out.println("Voltage " + voltLevel);

      return voltLevel &#60; LOW_LEVEL;
   }

   public void suppress() {
      suppressed = true;
   }

   public void action() {
      suppressed = false;
      play();
      System.exit(0);
   }

   public static void play() {
      for(int i=0;i &lt;note.length; ; i+=2) {
         final short w = note[i+1];
         Sound.playTone(note[i], w);
         Sound.pause(w*10);
         if (suppressed) return; // exit this method if suppress is called
      }
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>	
							
				<p>The complete tune is stored in the
				note array at line 6 and the method to play the notes is at line
				30. This behavior will take control only if the current battery
				level is less the voltage specified in the constructor. The
				takeControl() method looks a little inflated, and that's because
				it also displays the battery charge to the LCD display. The
				action() method is  comparatively easy. Action
				makes a bunch of noise, then exits the program.
			     Since this behavior stops the program, we might get away without a
                             a suppress() method.  But just in case we detect a wall,
                             while playing the tune, we use one.

				</p>
				
				<p>To insert this behavior into our
				scheme is a trivial task. We simply alter the code of our main
				class as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">

				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;

public class BumperCar {
   public static void main(String [] args) {
      Behavior b1 = new DriveForward();
      Behavior b2 = new BatteryLow(6.5f);
      Behavior b3 = new HitWall();
      Behavior [] bArray = {b1, b2, b3};
      Arbitrator arby = new Arbitrator(bArray);
      arby.start();
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>Note: The voltage level of the NXT
				at rest is different from the voltage when in action. The voltage
				level at rest might be 7.8 V, but when motors are activated they
				naturally cause a drop in the voltage reading. Make sure the
				voltage threshold used in the BatteryLow constructor is low
				enough.</p>
				
				<p>This example beautifully
				demonstrates the real benefit of behavior control coding.
				Inserting a new behavior, no matter what the rest of the code
				looks like, is simple. The reason for this is grounded in object
				oriented design; each behavior is a self contained, independent
				object.</p>
			
				<p>TIP: When creating a behavior
				control system, it is best to program each behavior one at a time
				and test them individually. If you code all the behaviors and then
				upload them all at once to the NXT brick, there is a good chance a
				bug will exist somewhere in the behaviors, making it difficult to
				locate. By programming and testing them one at a time it makes it
				easier to identify where the problem was introduced.</p>

				<h4>Notes on the recommended design pattern</h4>
                           <p>
			   In order to understand why we recommend this design pattern,
				it is useful to dig a little deeper into the inner workings of the arbitrator.
				 The Arbitrator contains a monitor thread that cycles through each of the behaviors,
				 checking the takeControl() method to see if  the behavior should become active.
				   It starts with behavior of largest index
				   (because they are are stored in increasing priority order)
				   and works down the array. As soon as it comes across a behavior
				   that should take control, this is the highest priority behavior
                                   that wants control at the moment.
				    If this behavior has higher priority than the active behavior,
				     the  monitor thread  executes suppress() on the active behavior,
				     and then starts checking each behavior from the top again.
				     The main thread of the Arbitrator is very simple.
				     It just calls  the action() method on the highest priority behavior,
				     (as determined by the Monitor thread) and that behavior becomes the active.
				      When action() exits, either because its task is complete or
                                      because the Monitor thread has called suppress in it,
                                      that  behavior is no longer active, and the loop continues,
                                      calling action() on the behavior that is now has
				      the highest priority as determined by the Monitor thread.
                                      It is possible that the same behavior repeatedly becomes active.

				</p>
				<p>It would be nice if all behaviors
				were as simple as the examples given above, but in more complex
				coding there are some unexpected results that can sometimes be
				introduced. If it is necessary to have a behavior that uses its own Thread,
                                for example, can sometimes be difficult to
				halt it  from the suppress() method, which can lead to two different
				threads fighting over the same resources - often the same motor!   But in this pattern,
                                the suppress() method does not try to halt anything.  It is the responsibility
                                of the action() method to keep testing the <code> suppressed </code> variable, exit as soon
                                as it become true, and leave the robot is a safe state for the next behavior.
				
                                </p>
     
				<p>
                     Another  advantage of  this design pattern is that each behavior is coded in the same way
		   without making any assumptions about its priority.  You can then change the priority order of
		   your behaviors or reuse them in other applications without reprogramming any of them.

					<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>Behavior coding is predominantly
				used for autonomous robots - robots that work independently, on
				their own free will. A robot arm controlled by a human would
				likely not use behavior programming, although it would be
				possible. For example, a robot arm with four joystick movements
				could have a behavior for each direction of movement. But as you
				may recall, behaviors are ordered with the highest order taking
				precedence over lower order behaviors. Who is to say that pushing
				left on the joystick would take precedence over pushing up? In
				other words, behavior control in anything other than autonomous
				robots is largely overkill.</p>
                                        
					<p>So why use the Behavior API? The
					best reason is because in programming we strive to create the
					simplest, most powerful solution possible, even if it takes
					slightly more time. The importance of reusable, maintainable code
					has been demonstrated repeatedly in the workplace, especially on
					projects involving more than one person. If you leave your code
					and come back to it several months later, the things that looked
					so obvious suddenly don't anymore. With behavior control, you can
					add and remove behaviors without even looking at the rest of the
					code, even if there are 10 or more behaviors in the program.
					Another big plus of behavior control is programmers can exchange
					behaviors with each other easily, which fosters code reusability.
					Hundreds of interesting, generic behaviors could be uploaded to
					websites, and you could simply pick the behaviors you want to add
					to your robot (assuming your robot is the correct type of robot).
					This reusability of code can be taken forward even more by using
					standard leJOS NXJ classes such as the Navigation API.</p>
