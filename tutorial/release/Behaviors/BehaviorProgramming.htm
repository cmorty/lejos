				<h4>Programming Behavior with leJOS NXJ</h4>

				<p>When most people start programming
				a robot, they think of the program flow as a series of if-thens,
				which is remeniscent of structured programming (Figure 1). This
				type of programming is very easy to get started in and hardly
				requires any thought or design beforehand. A programmer can just
				sit at the computer and start typing ( although a little thought before the typing may avoid a lot of grief later. )
				<br /><br /><img src="figure1.jpg" border="1" />
				<br />Fig 1  Structured programming visualized.<br />
				<br />The problem is, the code
				ends up as spaghetti code; all tangled up and difficult to expand.
				<br />The behavior control model, in contrast, requires a little more
				planning before coding begins, but the payoff is that each
				behavior is nicely encapsulated within an easy to understand
				structure. This will theoretically make your code easier to
				understand by other programmers familiar with the behavior control
				model, but more importantly it becomes very easy to add or remove
				specific behaviors from the overall structure, without negative
				repercussions to the rest of the code. </p>
			
				
				The concepts of Behavior Programming as implemented in leJOS NXJ  are very simple.:
			<ul>
			  <li>Only one behavior can be active and in control of the robot at any time.</li>
	          <li>Each behavior has a fixed priority.</li>
	          <li>Each behavior can determine if it should take control.</li>
	          <li>The active behavior has higher priority than any other behavior that should take control.</li>
           
			</ul>
	
		
			 <a name="2"></a>
				<h4>The Behavior API </h4>
				The Behavior API is is composed of only one interface and one class. 
				The Behavior interface defines the individual behavior classes.  
				The Behavior interface is very general and defines three public methods.  
				It works quite well because, even though the individual implementations of a behavior vary widely, 
				they are all treated alike.  Once all the behaviors are created, they are given to an 
				Arbitrator to regulate which behavior should be activated at any time.  
				The Arbitrator class and the Behavior interface are located the lejos.subsumption package. 
				The API for the Behavior interface is as follows.
				
				<a name="3"></a>
				
				<h5>lejos.subsumption.Behavior</h5>
		   <ul  class="BlueArrows"> 
			  <li> boolean takeControl()<br></br>
			  Returns a boolean value to indicate
				if this behavior should become active. For example, if a touch
				sensor indicates the robot has bumped into an object, this method
				should return true.
				</li>
					
			<li>
			void action()<br></br> 
					The code in this method initiates
				an action when the behavior becomes active. For example, if
				takeControl() detects the robot has collided with an object, the
				action() code could make the robot back up and turn away from the
				object.<br></br>
				 A behavior is active as long as its action() method is running. 		 
			</li>
			<li>
				 void suppress()<br></br>
					The code in the suppress() method
				should immediately terminate the code running in the action()
				method. The suppress() method can also be used to update any data
				before this behavior completes.
			</li>
			</ul>
			
        <p>   As you can see, the three methods
				in the Behavior interface are quite simple. If a robot has three
				discreet behaviors, then the programmer will need to create three
				classes, with each class implementing the Behavior interface. Once
				these classes are complete, the code should hand the behavior
				objects off to the Arbitrator to deal with.
				</p>
				
				<a name="4"></a>

				<h5>lejos.subsumption.Arbitrator</h5>				

				<p>The constructor is:</p>
				
				<ul class="BlueArrows">
					<li>public Arbitrator(Behavior [] behaviors, boolean returnWhenInactive)
						<p>Creates an Arbitrator object
						that regulates when each of the behaviors will become active.<br />Parameter: behaviors. 
						 The index of each behavior is its index in the array.  So behaviors[0] has the lowest priority. 
						 </p>
						 <p>Parameter:  boolean  returnWhenInacative; 
						  If true the program exits when there no behavior should take control. 
						   Otherwise, the program runs until shut down by pressing the Enter and Escape buttons. 
						    </p><p>Parameter: an array of Behaviors</p></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Public Methods:</p>

				
				<ul class="BlueArrows">
					<li><p>public void start() </p><p>Starts the arbitration system.</p></li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The Arbitrator class is even easier
				to understand than Behavior. When an Arbitrator object is
				instantiated, it is given an array of Behavior objects. Once it
				has these, the start() method is called and it begins arbitrating;
				deciding which behaviors should become active. The Arbitrator
				calls the takeControl() method on each Behavior object, starting
				with the object with the highest index number in the array. It
				works its way down through the array, (in decreasing priority order) 
				 till it finds a behavior that wants to take control.  
				If the  priority index of this behavior iis greater than that of the current active behavior, 
				 the active behavior is suppressed. 
				The action  method is then called on the behavior of this index.  
				As a result, if several  behaviors  want to take control,
				then only the only the highest priority behavior will become active.  (Figure 2).</p>
				
				<p><img src="figure2.jpg" border=1/></p>
				
				<p>Figure 2: Higher level behaviors suppress lower level behaviors.</p>
				
				<a name="5"></a>

				<h4>Coding Behaviors</h4>

				<p>Now that we are familiar with the
				Behavior API under leJOS, let's look at a simple example using
				three behaviors. For this example, we will program some behavior
				for a simple robot with differential steering. This robot will
				drive forward as it's primary low-level behavior. . This activity continues unless  the robotic hits an object,then a high priority behavior will become active to back the robot up and turn it 90 degrees. There will also be a third
				behavior which we will insert into the program after the first two
				have been completed. Let's start with the first behavior.</p>
				
				<p>As we saw in the Behavior
				interface, we must implement the methods action(), suppress(), and
				takeControl(). The behavior for driving forward will take place in
				the action() method. It simply needs to make motors A and C rotate
				forward and it  exits when  the motors are no longer moving. 
				This behavior  remains active as long as the motors are turning. 
				The method code is::</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public void action() {
  Motor.A.forward();
  Motor.C.forward();
  while(Motor.A.isMoving()|| Motor.C.isMoving()) 
      Thread.yield(); // wait for motors to stop}
				</code></pre>
				</div>
   
				<p>That was easy enough! Now the
				suppress() method will need to stop this action when it is called,
				as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public void suppress() {
  Motor.A.stop();
  Motor.C.stop);
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>So far, so good. Now we need to
				implement a method to tell Arbitrator when this behavior should
				become active. As we outlined earlier, this robot will drive
				forward always, unless something else suppresses it, so this
				behavior should always want to take control (it's a bit of a
				control freak). The takeControl() method should return true, no
				matter what is happening. This may seem counter intuitive, but
				rest assured that higher level behaviors will be able to cut in on
				this behavior when the need arises. The method appears as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">

				<pre><code>
public boolean takeControl() {
  return true;
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>That's all it takes to define our
				first behavior to drive the robot forward. The complete code
				listing for this class is as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;
import lejos.nxt.*;

public class DriveForward implements Behavior {
   public boolean takeControl() {
      return true;
   }

   public void suppress() {
      Motor.A.stop();
      Motor.C.stop();
   }

   public void action() {
      Motor.A.forward();
      Motor.C.forward();
      while(Motor.A.isMoving()|| Motor.C.isMoving()) 
      Thread.yield(); // wait for motors to stop}
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				
				<p>The second behavior is a little
				more complicated than the first, but still very similar. The main
				action of this behavior is to reverse and turn when the robot
				strikes an object or detects one close by.  In this example, we would like the behavior to
				take control only when the touch sensor strikes an object, 
				or the ultrasonic sensor gets an echo from a close object. Here is the takeConrol() method
				that does it: 
				</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public boolean takeControl() {
  return touch.isPressed() || sonar.getDistance() &#60; 25;
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>
				
				<p> This assumes that a TouchSensor object has been created in an instance variable called <i>touch</i>
				and a new  UltraSonicSensor object has been assigned to the variable <i>sonar</i>.</p>

				<p>For the action, we want the robot to back up
				and rotate when it strikes an object, so we will define the
				action() method as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
public void action();
Motor.A.rotate(-180,true);
Motor.C.rotate(-360,true); 

while(Motor.C.isRotatinng()) 
   Thread.yield();  // wait till turn is complete}			
				</code></pre>
				</div>
				
				<p>Defining the suppress() method for
				this behavior is quite easy in this example. The action() method
				above is the sort of method that runs very quickly (1.3 seconds)
				and is usually high priority. We can either stop it dead by
				stopping motor movement, or we could wait for it to complete the
				backing up maneuver. To keep things simple, lets just stop the
				motors from rotating:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">

				<pre><code>
public void suppress {
  Motor.A.stop();
  Motor.C.stop();
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>The complete listing for this behavior is as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;
import lejos.nxt.*;

public class HitWall implements Behavior {
   private TouchSensor touch = new TouchSensor(SensorPort. S1);
   private UltrasonicSensor sonar;
   
   public boolean takeControl() {
      return touch.isPressed();
   }

   public void suppress() {
      Motor.A.stop();
      Motor.C.stop();
   }

   public void action() {
       Motor.A.rotate(-180,true);
       Motor.C.rotate(-360,true); 
       while(Motor.C.isRotatinng()) 
          Thread.yield();  // wait till turn is complete}
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>We now have our two behaviors
				defined, and it's a simple matter to make a class with a main()
				method to get things started. All we need to do is create an array
				of our behavior objects, and instantiate and start the Arbitrator
				as shown in the following code listing:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;

public class BumperCar {
   public static void main(String [] args) {
      Behavior b1 = new DriveForward();
      Behavior b2 = new HitWall();
      Behavior [] bArray = {b1, b2};
      Arbitrator arby = new Arbitrator(bArray);
      arby.start();
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>The above code is fairly easy to
				understand. The first two lines in the main() method create
				instances of our behaviors. The third line places them into an
				array, with the lowest priority behavior taking the lowest array
				index. The fourth line creates the Arbitrator, and the fifth line
				starts the Arbitration process. When this program is started the
				robot will scurry forwards until it bangs into an object, then it
				will retreat, rotate, and continue with its forward movement until
				the power is shut off.</p>
				
				<p>This seems like a lot of extra work
				for two simple behaviors, but now let's see how easy it is to
				insert a third behavior without altering any code in the other
				classes. This is the part that makes behavior control systems very
				appealing for robotics programming. Our third behavior could be
				just about anything. We'll have this new behavior monitor the
				battery level and play a tune when it dips below a certain level.
				Examine the completed Behavior:</p>

				
				<div class="CodeBox">
				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;
import lejos.nxt.*;

public class BatteryLow implements Behavior {
   private float LOW_LEVEL;
   private boolean suppressed = false; 
   private static final short [] note = {
      2349,115, 0,5, 1760,165, 0,35, 1760,28, 0,13, 1976,23,
      0,18, 1760,18, 0,23, 1568,15, 0,25, 1480,103, 0,18,
      1175,180, 0,20, 1760,18, 0,23, 1976,20, 0,20, 1760,15,
      0,25, 1568,15, 0,25, 2217,98, 0,23, 1760,88, 0,33, 1760,
      75, 0,5, 1760,20, 0,20, 1760,20, 0,20, 1976,18, 0,23,
      1760,18, 0,23, 2217,225, 0,15, 2217,218};
   
   public BatteryLow(float volts) {
      LOW_LEVEL = volts;
   }

   public boolean takeControl() {
      float voltLevel = Battery.getVoltage();
      System.out.println("Voltage " + voltLevel);

      return voltLevel &#60; LOW_LEVEL;
   }

   public void suppress() {
      suppressed = true;
   }

   public void action() {
      suppressed = false;
      play();
      System.exit(0);
      }

   public static void play() {
      for(int i=0;i &lt;note.length; i+=2) {
         final short w = note[i+1];
         Sound.playTone(note[i], w);
         Sound.pause(w*10);
         if (suppressed) return; // exit this method if suppress is called
      }
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>	
							
				<p>The complete tune is stored in the
				note array at line 6 and the method to play the notes is at line
				30. This behavior will take control only if the current battery
				level is less the voltage specified in the constructor. The
				takeControl() method looks a little inflated, and that's because
				it also displays the battery charge to the LCD display. The
				action() and suppress() methods are comparatively easy. Action
				makes a bunch of noise, then exits the program.
			     Since this behavior stops the program, there is little need to
				create a suppress() method. But  just in case,  we declare a boolean flag 
				<i>suppressed</i>  which is set by the suppress() method and tested by the play() method 
				so it can interrupt the tune if a wall has been detected or hit.  
				</p>
				
				<p>To insert this behavior into our
				scheme is a trivial task. We simply alter the code of our main
				class as follows:</p>
				
				<div class="CodeBox">

				<pre><code>
import lejos.subsumption.*;

public class BumperCar {
   public static void main(String [] args) {
      Behavior b1 = new DriveForward();
      Behavior b2 = new BatteryLow(6.5f);
      Behavior b3 = new HitWall();
      Behavior [] bArray = {b1, b2, b3};
      Arbitrator arby = new Arbitrator(bArray);
      arby.start();
   }
}
				</code></pre>
				</div>

				<p>Note: The voltage level of the NXT
				at rest is different from the voltage when in action. The voltage
				level at rest might be 7.8 V, but when motors are activated they
				naturally cause a drop in the voltage reading. Make sure the
				voltage threshold used in the BatteryLow constructor is low
				enough.</p>
				
				<p>This example beautifully
				demonstrates the real benefit of behavior control coding.
				Inserting a new behavior, no matter what the rest of the code
				looks like, is simple. The reason for this is grounded in object
				oriented design; each behavior is a self contained, independent
				object.</p>
			
				<p>TIP: When creating a behavior
				control system, it is best to program each behavior one at a time
				and test them individually. If you code all the behaviors and then
				upload them all at once to the NXT brick, there is a good chance a
				bug will exist somewhere in the behaviors, making it difficult to
				locate. By programming and testing them one at a time it makes it
				easier to identify where the problem was introduced.</p>
				
				<p>Behavior coding is predominantly
				used for autonomous robots - robots that work independently, on
				their own free will. A robot arm controlled by a human would
				likely not use behavior programming, although it would be
				possible. For example, a robot arm with four joystick movements
				could have a behavior for each direction of movement. But as you
				may recall, behaviors are ordered with the highest order taking
				precedence over lower order behaviors. Who is to say that pushing
				left on the joystick would take precedence over pushing up? In
				other words, behavior control in anything other than autonomous
				robots is largely overkill.</p>

				
				<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
			
				<a name="6"></a>
				<h4>Advanced Behavior Coding</h4>

				<p>It would be nice if all behaviors
				were as simple as the examples given above, but in more complex
				coding there are some unexpected results that can sometimes be
				introduced. Threads, for example, can sometimes be difficult to
				halt from the suppress() method, which can lead to two different
				threads fighting over the same resources - often the same motor!  
				Furthermore, when an action() method exits, it may leave side effects that 
				could cause trouble for the next behavior that becomes active. 
				This section, we introduces a design pattern that avoids some of these problems.
			
				</p>
				
				<a name="7"></a>

				<h5>Coding solid  behaviors</h5>
				 In order to code reliable  action() and suppress() pairs, 
				it is necessary to understand how arbitration works.  
				 The Arbitrator contains a monitor thread that cycles through each of the behaviors, 
				 checking the takeControl() method to see if  the behavior should become active. 
				   It starts with behavior of largest index 
				   (because they are are stored in increasing priority order) 
				   and works down the array. As soon as it comes across a behavior 
				   that should take control, this is the highest priority behavior at the moment. 
				    If this behavior has higher priority than the active behavior, 
				     the  monitor thread  executes suppress() on the active behavior, 
				     and then starts checking each behavior from the top again. 
				     The main thread of the Arbitrator is very simple.  
				     It just calls  the action() method on the highest priority behavior, 
				     (as determined by the Monitor thread) and that behavior becomes the active. 
				      When action() exits,  that  behavior is no longer active, and the loop continues, calling action() on the behavior that is now has 
				      the highest priority.  It is possible that the same behavior repeatedly becomes active.
				      
		 <p> For reliable performance of the behavior control system, it is essential that action() method  terminates
		 promptly when suppress() is called.  One way to guarantee this is to define a boolean flag <i> suppressed </i> 
		 in each behavior.
		 This variable is set to <i>true</i> by the suppress() method and tested in every loop of the action()
		  method. Of course, the first thing an action() method must do is set this flag to <i>false</i>. 
		 The action() method might be quite complex, such as a separate thread for line tracking or wall following, 
		 but it must be  coded to ensure prompt exit from action() when necessary. 
		  This <b>recommended design pattern</b> is illustrated in the BatteryLow code . 
		  Below are examples of the other BumperCar behaviors revised according to this design pattern. </p>

		<p>
		As you can see from these examples, the motor shutdown code  that was in suppress() 
		has been moved to the end of action(). In this pattern, it is the responsibility of the 
		action() method to do any clean up work so that no side effects are left that might interfere 
		with the next behavior to become active. The danger of a side effect may not be obvious. 
		 </p>		
		 <p>
		 Suppose, for example, in the DriveForward behavior, the action() method does not test the  
		 suppressed  flag but instead  starts the motors driving forward and then exits, 
		 leaving the side effect of motors running.  If a higher priority behavior should take control,
		  there is no problem. Otherwise,  DriveForward.action() will  immediately be called again. 
		  So where is the problem?  Answer:  Repeated calls of any Motor method will reduce the 
		  accuracy of motor speed regulation. Speed regulation works by comparing the total motor rotation 
		  with the desired speed times elapsed time, and adjusting power to reduce the error.  
		  Each call to a Motor method resets the origin of both elapsed time and rotation count, 
		  so calling a motor method every few milliseconds soon makes speed regulation ineffective.  
		  If the motors do not run at the same speed, the robot will not move in a straight line.  
		  So if you want your robot to run straight, be careful about how you code your action() methods. 
		   </p>
		   One advantage of using this design pattern is that each behavior is coded in the same way 
		   without making any assumptions about its priority.  You can then change the priority order of 
		   your behaviors or reuse them in other applications without reprogramming any of them.

		   <p>
		   Note: If you would like to remove any mystery about what goes on in the Arbitrator class, 
		   take a look at the source code located in src/classes/lejos/subsumption/Arbitrator.java.

					<h4>Summary</h4>
			
					<p>So why use the Behavior API? The
					best reason is because in programming we strive to create the
					simplest, most powerful solution possible, even if it takes
					slightly more time. The importance of reusable, maintainable code
					has been demonstrated repeatedly in the workplace, especially on
					projects involving more than one person. If you leave your code
					and come back to it several months later, the things that looked
					so obvious suddenly don't anymore. With behavior control, you can
					add and remove behaviors without even looking at the rest of the
					code, even if there are 10 or more bahaviors in the program.
					Another big plus of behavior control is programmers can exchange
					behaviors with each other easily, which fosters code reusability.
					Hundreds of interesting, generic behaviors could be uploaded to
					websites, and you could simply pick the behaviors you want to add
					to your robot (assuming your robot is the correct type of robot).
					This reusability of code can be taken forward even more by using
					standard leJOS NXJ classes such as the Navigation API.</p>
