				<a id="1" name="1"></a><h4>What is leJOS NXJ</h4>
				<p>
				leJOS  NXJ is a Java programming environment for the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT ®. It allows you to program LEGO ® robots in Java.
				</p>
				<p>
				It consists of:
				</p>
				<ul class="BlueArrows2">
					
<li>Replacement firmware for the NXT that includes a Java Virtual Machine.</li>
<li>A library of Java classes (classes.jar) that implement the leJOS NXJ Application Programming Interface (API).</li>
<li>A linker for linking user Java classes with classes.jar  to form a .binary file that can be uploaded and run on the NXT.</li>
<li>PC tools for flashing the firmware, uploading programs, debugging, and many other functions.</li>
<li>A PC API for writing PC programs that communicate  with leJOS NXJ programs using Java streams over Bluetooth or USB, or using the LEGO Communications Protocol.</li>
<li>Many sample programs</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
As leJOS is a firmware replacement, the new firmware leJOS NXJ firmware must be flashed onto the NXT, and will replace the standard LEGO MINDSTORMS firmware. This wipes out any files currently held on the LEGO firmware. The LEGO firmware can be restored using the LEGO supplied software.
				</p>
				<p>
leJOS  is an open source project hosted in the sourceforge  repository.  It was originally created from the TinyVM project that implemented a Java VM for the LEGO Mindstorms RCX system.  The RCX version of leJOS  proved very popular with the LEGO Mindstorms  Robotic Inventions Systems owners, and close to 200,000 downloads of all versions of leJOS have been done.  The original author of TinyVM and the RCX version of leJOS  was Jose Solorzano.
				</p>
				<p>
The NXT has given the leJOS  development team the opportunity to greatly expand the capability of leJOS.

				<a id="2" name="2"></a><h4>Advantages of leJOS NXJ</h4>
<p>
There are many advantages of using leJOS  NXJ rather than the NXT-G or other programming environments for the NXT. These include:
</p>
				<ul class="BlueArrows2">
					
<li>It uses the industry-standard Java language.</li>
<li>It provides object-oriented programming.</li>
<li>It is an open source project with many contributors.</li>
<li>It allows you a choice of professional Integrated Development Environment such as Eclipse and Netbeans that support syntax directed editors and many other features.</li>
<li>It has cross platform support – Windows, Linux, Mac OS X.</li>
<li>It is much faster than NXT-G.</li>
<li>It has full support for Bluetooth.</li>
<li>It provides highly accurate motor control.</li>
<li>It has advanced navigation support.</li>
<li>It provides Behavior classes that support the subsumption architecture foe ease of programming of complex robot behaviors.</li>
<li>It supports third party sensors.</li>
<li>It supports remote monitoring and tracing of your leJOS NXJ program from the PC.</li>
<li>It provides trigonometry and other Math functions</li>
<li>It supports the J2ME LCD user Interface including many graphics functions.</li>
<li>It supports multithreading.</li>
<li>It supports listeners and events.</li>
<li>It supports safe memory management with garbage collection</li>
<li>It has USB support including Java streams over USB and USB debugging.</li>
<li>It supports standard Java Communication streams</li>
<li>It has a flash file system accessed by the standard java.io classes.</li>
<li>It supports data logging and remote capturing of the logs.</li>
<li>It has sound support including playing 8-bit WAV files</li>
<li>It provides dozens of sample programs.</li>
<li>It supports remote execution from the PC using iCommand.</li>
<li>The Web site has online forums to help solve any problems you might have, to share projects ideas, and to communicate with the development team.</li>
<li>It has telerobotics support via standard TCP/IP sockets.</li>
<li>It supports NXT to NXT Bluetooth communications.</li>
<li>It supports Bluetooth communication with other devices.</li>
<li>It supports two-way communication with RCX via third party adapters such as the Mindsensors NRLink.</li>
<li>It provides compatibility with Lego Communications Protocol, so that many tools that work with the standard LEGO firmware, also work with leJOS.</li>
<li>It has an easy to use menu system.</li>
<li>It is widely used by universities and other education establishments.</li>
<li>It has computer Vision and speech support via iCommand.</li>
