<h1>Creating a leJOS NXJ project</h1>
To compile programs with the leJOS NXJ API and upload them to the NXT brick, you need to create a project of the appropriate type.
This is done the following way:
<ol>
<li>Create (or import) a Java project.</li>
<li>Select the project in the <b>Package Explorer</b> of the Java perspective and open its context menu.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <em>leJOS NXJ</em> menu and select <em>Convert to leJOS NXJ project</em>. The project's nature will be changed 
and the classpath will be adapted so that the leJOS NXJ jars will be used for compilation and linkage.</li>
</ol>
Note; if some error occurs, consult Eclipse's <b>Console</b> view for details.
