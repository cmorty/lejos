For running the ant based release utilities successfully, you will need to have

- an ANT installation (at least 1.6)
- all projects downloaded from SVN and updated

To create a new release of leJOS NXJ in Eclipse on Linux, please perform the following steps:

1. Update the following files:
	release/lejos_nxj/README.txt
	release/lejos_nxj/README.html
	release/lejos_nxj/RELEASENOTES
	and other documentation for the release
2. Update the following files with the current version number:
	nxtvm/platform/nxt/version.mak
	startup/src/lejos/nxt/startup/Config.java
	release/build.properties
	installjammer/leJOS_NXJ_Installer.iss
4. Ensure you have the latest firmware and the lated native libraries. The release/build.xml does
   not build them. The files are located at
	pccomms/native/...
	snapshot/bin/lejos_nxt_rom.bin
6. Test that all the samples and pcsamples run successfully.
9. Make sure that the Linux ant build file in the release/lejos_nxj/build is uptodate and works.
10. Check the the API docs builds without errors or warnings.
12. Ensure that the release/build.xml script is up to date
13. Build and test the Eclipse plugin - see EclipsePlugin.HOWTO
14. Build the Netbeans plugin using the latest version  of the org.lejos.example project.
    Make sure you generate a new .nbm file in the build directory.
15. Update this file if there are any changes in the way the release is built
16. Right click on release/build.xml and select "Run As", "Ant Build"
17. After the ant script has finished, the packed distributions for Linux and Windows may be found
    inside the folder release/dist.

18. Install Inno Setup (unicode version) and open/compile installjammer/leJOS_NXJ_Installer.iss
19. After that, the installer can be found at installjammer/leJOS_NXJ_<version>_win32_setup.exe

   htdocs/nxt/nxj/tutorial. Rename the old version first, by appending its version number.
C. Test the release Windows installer and other distribution on as many operating systems as possible. Ensure
   that the instructions in README.hml and in the tutorial work for this release.
D. Release the Windows installer and zip file versions, and the Linux/MAC OSX distribution using the sourceforge
   File Release System.
E. Copy the classes api docs to htdocs/nxt/nxj/api on the sourceforge web site.
