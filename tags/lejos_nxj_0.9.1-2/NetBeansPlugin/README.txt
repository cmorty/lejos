THE NETBEANS PLUGIN for NXJ.

This plugin gives Netbeans the ability to easily open a sample NXJ project
that you can as the starting point for your work.  
You can use many of the Netbeans short cuts that are available in the standard Java projects.
Open a sample project  by using  File/New Project. Select the NXJ Project  at the top of the
list of Java projects.    Click next and enter your project name.  Brose the to the location where
you want your project to be stored, and click finish.  

The sample project contains a three files that you can use as a starting point for you project development.
They are in the  sample  package.   You can use refactor to change the package name. 

After the plugin is installed,  you can open the various NXJ Tools with only two clicks.   In the Window tab,
just click on NXJTools to open the window, then click on the button for the tool you need.

 and click on  nxjplugincode.nbm.   Click on it, and it will be installed.

HOW TO UPDATE THE PLUGIN

The nxjplugincode.nbm file is generated by the NXJPlugin2 project and put in the build folder.
The source file it uses is src/nxjplugin/NXJSampleProject.zip
The easiest way to modify this zip file is
1. Open the NXJSample project  and the NXJPlugin2 project.
2. Make the desired changes in the NXJSample.  
   You can make any changes you wish in src. 
   You can also edit build.xml  and build.properties.
3. Run the  zipme target in build.xml   This will update NXJSampleProject.zip  in NXJPlugin2.src.
4. In Project view, right click on the NXJPlugin2 project and select Install/reload in Development IDE
   You can now open a sample NXJ project  and test it.
5. Right click NXJPlugin icon and click Create NBM.  The new nxjplugincode.nbm file will be in NXJPlugin/build.
