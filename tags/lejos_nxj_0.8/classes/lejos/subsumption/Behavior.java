* The Behavior interface represents an object embodying a specific

* 2) The action to perform when this behavior takes control. 
* e.g. Back up and turn.<BR>
* 3) The tasks to perform when another behavior has seized control from this
* behavior, including interrupting it.  S
* e.g. Stop the current movement and update coordinates.<BR>
* These are represented by defining the methods takeControl(), action(),
* and suppress() respectively. <BR>
* A behavior control system has one or more Behavior objects. When you have defined
* these objects, create an array of them and use that array to initialize an
* Arbitrator object.
