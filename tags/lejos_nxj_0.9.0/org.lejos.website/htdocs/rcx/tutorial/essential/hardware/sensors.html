        <!-- intro -->
        <img src="../../images/sensors.jpg">
        <br clear="all">
        Sensors are the senses of your robot, which enables it to generate an inner model of its
        environment and to react to events accordingly.
        <p>
        There's a bunch of hardware sensors available which may be connected to one of the three
        gray ports mounted above the RCX's display:
        <br>
        <img src="../../images/rcx_sensors.gif">
        <br clear="all">
        <p>

        <!-- access -->
        Similarly to the motor ports, the three ports are implemented as static fields 
        of the <code>Sensor</code> class:
        <ul>
            <li>Sensor.S1</li>
            <li>Sensor.S2</li>
            <li>Sensor.S3</li>
        </ul>
        Hence a typical call would be 
        <pre><code>
            Sensor.S1.readValue();
        </code></pre>

        <span class="remark">Another possibility to access the sensor ports is via the 
        static <code>Sensor[]</code> array, which contains the three sensors.
        </span>

        <!-- configuring -->
        <h2>Configuring a sensor</h2>
        Before data can be read from a sensor, it has to be configured, which means that you have to tell
        the actual instance of the <code>Sensor</code> 
        <ul>
            <li>which kind of sensor is connected and</li>
            <li>in which kind of mode the sensor data should be read.</li>
        </ul>
        This is done by the <code>public static void setTypeAndMode(int aType, int aMode)</code> method, where
        <code>type</code> is one of the five types
        <ul>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_TYPE_LIGHT: light sensor</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_TYPE_ROT: rotation sensor</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_TYPE_TEMP: temperature sensor</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_TYPE_TOUCH: touch sensor</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_TYPE_RAW: unspecific sensor for raw data reading</li>
        </ul>
        <code>mode</code> can be set to 
        <ul>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_ANGLE: angle measurement (for rotation sensors)</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_BOOL: pressed/not pressed measurement (for touch sensors)</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_DEGC: Celsius measurement (for temperature sensors)</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_DEGF: Fahrenheit measurement (for temperature sensors)</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_EDGE: edge counting, which counts the number of times the 
            state of a touch sensor changes</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_PCT: percent measurement (for light sensors)</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_PULSE: click count (for touch sensors)</li>
            <li>SensorConstants.SENSOR_MODE_RAW: raw value measurement (0 - 1023).</li>
        </ul>
        The edge mode has some peculiarity: when the RCX is turned off, the counter remains its values.
        So be sure to call <code>Sensor.setPreviousValue(0)</code> before starting new measurements.
        <p>

        <span class="remark">When configuring the sensor make sure that you use a meaningful
        combination of mode and type else the measured value won't make much sense.
        </span>
        <p>

        <!-- activating -->
        <h2>Activating a sensor</h2>
        Some of the sensors, such as light sensors, require electricity to work. By calling
        <code>Sensor.activate()</code> the sensor port in question is "switched on" in a sense
        that it constantly toggles between supplying power to the connected sensor and reading
        data (the light sensor's electronics smoothens out this toggling so you won't notice it).
        <br>The opposite <code>Sensor.passivate()</code> method turns off this power supply.

        <h2>Reading a sensor's value</h2>
        The easiest way to read a sensor's value is the use of one of
        the <code>read...()</code> methods:
        <ul>
            <li>public static boolean readBooleanValue()</li>
            <li>public static int readValue()</li>
            <li>public static int readRawValue()</li>
        </ul>
        which delivers the actual state or the measured data of the sensor at the moment the
        method is called (keep in mind to use the correct method depending on the type and mode
        the sensor was configured before!).
        <p>
        <span class="remark">There's is an additional low-level API method
            <code>public static int readSensorValue(int aSensorId,int aRequestType)</code>
            where <code>aSensorId</code> is the sensor's id (0,1,2) and 
            <code>aRequestType</code> is the type of data to read (0 = raw value,
            1 = configured value,2 = boolean value).  
        </span>
        <p>

        In most cases, though, you might want to be notified when some sensor is "triggered"
        or measures a certain value.
        For such cases you will use Java's <b>event listener</b> technology:
        <br>
        Your class to listen for such a sensor event will implement the 
        <code>public void stateChanged(Sensor aSource, int aOldValue, int aNewValue)</code> method 
        of the <code>josx.platform.rcx.SensorListener</code> interface,  where the two
        value parameters reflect the value before and after the change in value measurement:
        <pre><code>
            public class MySensorListener implements SensorListener {
                public void stateChanged(Sensor aSource, int aOldValue, int aNewValue) {
                    // respond to sensor value change here
                } // stateChanged()
            } // class MySensorListener
        </code></pre>

        Now you are able to add this class as a listener to the sensor port in question:
        <pre><code>
            Sensor.S1.addSensorListener(mySensorListener);
        </code></pre>

        Every time the sensor notifies a change in the value it measures, the  
        <code>stateChanged()</code> method of the 
        <code>MySensorListener</code> will be called.
        <br>This technology is extremely useful for touch sensors, for example.
        <p>

        <span class="remark">If you are unfamiliar with event listeners, feel free to consult the
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html" target="_top">
        section</a> of The Java Tutorial&trade; in question.
        </span>
        <p>

        <h2>A convenience sensor: ProximitySensor</h2>
        When the first versions of the leJOS platform were released it was quickly detected 
        that a special class for the detection of proximity would be quite useful: 
        your robot wouldn't have to bump into objects any longer to detect their existence by the
        means of a touch sensor  but were able to avoid it by using the light sensor for perception.
        <br>Yet the implementation wasn't as easy as the idea sounded: the values measured by the 
        light sensors vary immensely among two measurements even if there is no object nearby.
        <br>So the <code>ProximitySensor</code> which tackled that issue
        was added to the <code>josx.platform.rcx</code> package. 
        <br>It's not a subclass of the <code>Sensor</code> class, but is constructed with one.
        In the constructor you also might set the threshold, a integer value which defines
        the distance to an object by which the sensor is triggered: the bigger the value, the
        closer the robot gets.
        <br>
        The sensor is used by calling the <code>waitTillNear(long aMilliseconds)</code>
        method which blocks the current thread until an object is detected; the parameter defines
        how long may be waited, where 0 means forever (until an object is in fact detected).

        <h2>An example which uses the Sensor class</h2>
        is <b>Rotator.java</b> which may be found in the <code>examples/rotator</code> 
        section of the leJOS tree.

        <h2>The Sensor API</h2>
