				<h4>The NXJ Browser</h4>
	
				<p>leJOS NXJ includes a PC-based file browser for viewing and manipulating the files on the NXT.</p>
				
				<p>It is started by the nxjbrowse script. If you are using an IDE, you can set NXJ Browse up as an external tool.</p>
				
				<p>The NXJ Browser need the NXT it is
				connecting to, to be turned on and to be running the leJOS
				start-up menu. Although it should work while a user program is
				running, if the program starts the LCPBTResponder thread, this is
				not recommended.</p>
			
				<p>The NXJ Browser first looks for a NXT connected by USB, and if it finds one shows just that in the selection window.</p>
				
				<p>If it cannot find a USB-connected
				NXT, it does a Bluetooth inquiry to find any NXTs in range and
				shows them in the selection window. You then select the one you
				wish to connect to, and press connect.</p>
				
				<img src="nxjbrowseselect.png" border=1/>

				<p>After pressing Connect, the main browser screen is shown:</p>
				
				<img src="nxjbrowser.png" border=1/>

				<p>The NXJ browser shows you all the
				files on your NXT, together with their size in bytes and their
				location in the file system (start page, end page). See
				&ldquo;Understanding the leJOS NXJ File System&rdquo; to
				understand the meaning of the start and end pages.</p>
			
				<p>The friendly name of the NXT you
				are connected to is shown in the title bar of the Windows &ndash;
				the name is &ldquo;NXT&rdquo; in this case.</p>
				
				<p>From this screen, you can:</p>
				
				<ul class="BlueArrows">
					<li><p>Delete programs</p></li>
					<li><p>Upload programs and other files to the NXT</p></li>
					<li><p>Download files from the NXT to the OC</p></li>
					<li><p>Run programs</p></li>
					<li><p>De-fragment the file system</p></li>
					<li><p>Set the friendly name of the NXT</p></li>
				</ul>

	        	<a name="2"></a>
				<h5>Deleting programs</h5>
			
				<p>To delete files from the NXT, click
				the <i><b>Delete</b></i> tick boxes and press <i><b>Delete Files</b></i>.
				The next will make a chirping sound for each file deleted, and the
				NXJ Browser display will be updated. If the NXT is on the Files
				menu, its LCD will also be updated. An automatic defrag will occur
				when files are deleted, so there should be no gaps in the file
				system.</p>
				
				<a name="3"></a>
				<h5>Uploading files</h5>

				<p>When you click <i><b>Upload File,
				</b></i>an Open file dialog box appears. Browse for the file you
				want to upload, select it, and click <b>Open</b>. NXJ Browse is
				not normally used for uploading program files as this is better
				done using the <i><b>nxj</b></i> or <i><b>nxjupload</b></i> tool
				or the leJOS Eclipse plugin. However, it is useful for uploading
				WAV files and data files for programs.</p>
				
				<a name="4"></a>
				<h5>Downloading files</h5>				

				<p>Files can be downloaded from the
				NXT to the PC by selecting the NXT file and pressing &ldquo;Download&rdquo;.
				This open a dialog that allows you to select the folder and
				filename to download the file to.</p>
				
				<a name="5"></a>
				<h5>Running programs</h5>

				<p>A program on the NXT can be run by
				selecting it and pressing &ldquo;Run&rdquo;. This shuts down NXJ
				Browser.</p>
				
				<a name="6"></a>
				<h5>De-fragmenting the file system</h5>				

				<p>The NXT file system cab be
				defragmented (removing any gaps between files) by pressing
				&ldquo;Defrag&rdquo;. In the latest versions of leJOS the file
				system does not normally need to be defragmented.</p>
				
				<a name="7"></a>
				<h5>Setting the friendly name of the NXT</h5>

				<p>The Bluetooth friendly name of the
				NXT can be set by pressing &ldquo;Set Name&rdquo;, filling in the
				name (up to 16 characters) and pressing OK. Note that the
				Bluetooth power be on in order to set the friendly name, even if
				the connection to the NXT is by USB.</p>

				<h4>Remote Monitoring and Tracing</h4>				

				<p>You can monitor a leJOS program
				over a Bluetooth connection while it is running by starting the
				LCPBTResponder thread and running the NXJ Monitor tool on the PC.</p>
				<p>You an example of this, see the
				MonitorTest sample.</p>
				
				<p>NXJ Monitor lets you see the values
				of sensors, and the values of motor tachometers, in near
				real-time, while your program executes.</p>
				
				<p>It also lets you program displaying
				tracing messages to indicate what it is doing. These are displayed
				on the NXJ Monitor screen.</p>
				
				<p>The program being monitored should
				include the following code in its start-up sequence:</p>
				
				<pre class="CodeBox"><code>LCPBTResponder lcpThread = new LCPBTResponder();
lcpThread.setDaemon(true);
lcpThread.start();</code></pre>
			
				<p>On the PC, the NXJ Monitor tool
				should be run. NXJ Monitor lists the NXTs available over Bluetooth
				in the same way as the NXJ Browser tool, and lets you choose which
				one you wish to connect to.</p>
				<p>When a connection has been made,
				the following window is displayed:</p>

				<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
				
				<a name="9"></a>
				<h4>Data Viewer</h4>

				<p>The Data Viewer displays the output
				from DataLogger. You can cut and paste the data into a spreadsheet
				for further analysis. It uses USB by default, but you can select
				Bluetooth if you wish. When you start the program, this window
				appears:</p>
				
				<img src="nxjdataviewer.png" border=1/>
				
				<p>It connects to the NXT via USB by
				default, but if you click the <i>Use BlueTooth </i>button, it
				will.. For the fastest BlueTooth connection, enter the Bluetooth
				address. If you don&rsquo;t know it, enter the NXT name.
				Otherwise, the program will take some time to search and complete
				the connection. By default, the program displays 2 data values per
				row, but you can enter any number you wish before starting to
				download. The DataLogger gives you the option to resending its
				data if you want to see it again (with a different row length for
				example). If you do, click the <i>Start Download</i> button
				again..</p>

				<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
				
				<a name="10"></a>
				<h4>The Console viewer</h4>

				<p>The Console Viewer displays the
				output from RConsole, which is described in the section of Error
				Handling and Debugging. When you start the program, this window
				appears:</p>
				
				<img src="nxjdataviewer.png" border=1/>
			
				<p>It connects to the NXT via USB by
				default, but if you click the <i>Use BlueTooth </i>button, it
				will. For the fastest BlueTooth connection, enter the Bluetooth
				address. If you don&rsquo;t know it, enter the NXT name.
				Otherwise, the program will take some time to search and complete
				the connection.</p>
				
				<p>The <i>Connect</i> button will
				initiate the connection with the NXT provided that the RConsole
				program is running on the NXT. 
				</p>
				
				<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

				<h4>NXJFlashG</h4>

				<p>This is the GUI version of NXJFlash. It
				installs the firmware into the flash memory of your NXT.  If your
				NXT has a recent version of the firmware already installed,  it
				only needs to be turned on and connected to the PC with the USB
				cable. Otherwise, it needs to be put into firmware update mode by 
				pressing the reset button for 4 seconds or more.</p>
				
				<p>When the program opens, it looks like this:</p>
				
				<img src="nxjflashg.png" border=1/>
				
				<p>When	you click start you see this :</p>
				
				<img src="clickok.png" border=1/>
				
				<p>The next message is :</p>
				
				<img src="clearmemory.png" border=1/>
				
				<p>If you click Yes, the entire flash memory of
				the NXT will be cleared. If you click no and the installation
				fails, it might be because the the flash memory has been badly
				corrupted. In which case, try again and click Yes. 
				</p>
				
				<p>As the installation proceeds, the progress log
				will be written. At the end, you have a chance to install firmware
				again.</p>
