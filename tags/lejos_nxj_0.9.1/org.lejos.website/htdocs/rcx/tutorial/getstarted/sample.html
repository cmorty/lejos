        <h1>Lesson: A Sample Application</h1>
        <p>

        <!-- overview -->
        In this section we will take a closer look on a simple sample application using the leJOS API
        and discuss some of its fundamental concepts.<br>
        We assume your RCX is connected to a motor via a cable mounted on port A.

        <!-- sample -->
        <h2>The complete program</h2>

        <pre><code>
            import josx.platform.rcx.*;

            //////////////////////////////////////

            public class SimpleSample {        

                ////////////////////////////////////////////
                // public methods

                ////////////////////////////////////////////
                /**
                 * main method 
                 * @throws InterruptedException
                 */
                public static void main(String[] args) 
                    throws InterruptedException {

                    // message
                    TextLCD.print("DRIVE");

                    // drive forward
                    Motor.A.forward();

                    // just run until RUN button is pressed again
                    Button.RUN.waitForPressAndRelease();

                } // main()

            } // class SimpleSample
        </code></pre>

        <!-- import -->
        <h2>The import statement</h2>
        <pre><code>
            import josx.platform.rcx.*;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
        The basic package, which contains most of the essential leJOS classes, is <code>josx.platform.rcx</code>.
        The name is somewhat due to historical reasons, for Jose Solarzano was the inventor and first developer of leJOS.
        <br>
        For an overview of this package consult the <a href="http://lejos.sourceforge.net/apidocs/index.html">API</a>.

        <!-- main -->
        <h2>The entry point: main()</h2>
        <pre><code>
        public static void main(String[] args) 
                    throws InterruptedException {
        </code></pre>
        <p>
        As with most Java applications, the entry point of a lejos program is the <code>main()</code> method.
        <br>
        In our case, it throws a <code>InterruptedException</code> arising  eventually from the 
        <code>Button.RUN.waitForPressAndRelease()</code> call below.
        <br>
        What will happen when such an exception occurs? 
        <br>The RCX will stop the execution of the <code>main()</code> method and
        display some (rather cryptic) error information on its LCD. For details see the section on exceptions
        later in this tutorial.

        <!-- LCD output -->
        <h2>Output</h2>
        <pre><code>
        TextLCD.print("DRIVE");
        </code></pre>
        <p>
        You might have noticed that the graphical user interface of the RCX is rather limited - 
        in fact, there's only the little LCD in its middle for such a purpose.<br>
        Thus the abilities of a leJOS program for visual output are quite weak (compared to Java applications 
        running on a PC) - a fact that makes debugging in leJOS a somewhat challenging task.<br>
        After all, there's the possibility to write up to five numbers or letters to the LCD using the static
        methods of the <code>TextLCD</code> or the <code>LCD</code> class.
        <p>
        
        <span class="remark">
                There ARE mechanisms, though, to display graphical information to the user: you 
                might transfer information to the IR tower using the IR sensor
                in front of the RCX and display it on your PC's screen. However, 
                this is a more advanced feature - see the specialized trail on communication 
                contained in this tutorial.
        </span>
        <p>

        You already might have noticed two things of importance here:
        <ol>
            <li>You can use the well-known <code>java.lang.String</code> class in leJOS.</li>
            <li>You use static methods of <code>TextLCD</code>. This is a major concept of leJOS:
            The classes which are directly connected to the actual RCX hardware parts - e.g. motors,
            sensors, buttons or the LCD - are designed to be static ones. As a result you never will construct
            any of these but just use the methods of the existing single instance.
        </ol>
        
        <!-- LCD output -->
        <h2>Running a motor</h2>
        <pre><code>
        // drive forward
        Motor.A.forward();
        </code></pre>
        <p>
        This piece of code runs the motor connected to the RCX's port A in "forward" mode 
        (the direction the motor actually spins depends on the orientation in which you mounted the 
        connector).<br>
        Again note that you use a static instance of the <code>Motor</code> class - to be more precise,
        a static member (named <code>A</code>) of this class, which refers to "motor connected to port A".
        As you might have already guessed, the two other motors are referred to as <code>Motor.B</code>
        and <code>Motor.C</code>, respectively.
        <br>You see that you don't have to bother with any hardware aspect or electro engineering here -
        just one single line of code and your motor will run! It's pretty easy, isn't it?
        <p>
        If the motor in question is connected to some wheel assembly accurately, your robot will now 
        drive forward.

        <!-- wait -->
        <h2>Keep on running</h2>
        <pre><code>
        // just run until RUN button is pressed again
        Button.RUN.waitForPressAndRelease();
        </code></pre>
        <p>
        <em>So, what's the use of this?</em> you might be tempted to ask at this point of time, 
        <em>Isn't my robot running yet?</em>. <br>
        The answer is: yes AND no.<br>
        Let's take a look at the program and assume the last statement would be missing:
        <ol>
            <li>The motor is running now and the <code>Motor.forward()</code> method returns immediately, 
                so the program moves to the next statement.</li> 
            <li>But there is none, so  <code>main()</code> comes to an end and 
                returns control to the operating system, which terminates program execution 
                (for there is no thread left to be executed).</li> 
            <li>This results, among others, in the motor stopping.</li>
            <li>Thus, the effect of the missing <code>Button.RUN.waitForPressAndRelease()</code>
            statement is the motor running for a very short period of time (maybe not noticeable at all,
            leaving behind a staggered user) and stopping right away.</li>
        </ol>
        Regarding this we have to assure that program execution doesn't stop or a least at the point of time
        we choose it to.<br>
        As always, there are many ways to accomplish this task. One of the simplest ones, though, is
        to force the program waiting for the user pressing and releasing the <em>RUN</em> 
        button which is easily got by <code>Button.RUN.waitForPressAndRelease()</code>.
