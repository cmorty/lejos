How to use NXT Lejos with the Samba RAM Loader on a Linux system:

- Build a GCC toolchain, use the instructions at Gnuarm for gcc 4.0.2

- Go to libnxt and build the runjava utility, just run scons

- Go to nxtvm/platform/nxt, edit environment.mak w.r.t. the location
  of the toolchain, run make

- Do a long reset on your NXT to put it in Samba mode
  (you need to redo this only if you flash other firmware,
   but not after running a program in Samba RAM mode)

- Connect it to the host computer

- Give yourself access rights on the USB device, e.g.

  sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/002/029

  The numbers will vary, the last number counts up
  for every disconnect/connect of the NXT.

- Run a Java example, e.g. 
  ../../../libnxt/runjava lejos_nxt_samba_ram.bin ../../../examples/View/View.bin

- A Java program will power down the NXT when it stops.
  If it doesn't, remove a battery.
