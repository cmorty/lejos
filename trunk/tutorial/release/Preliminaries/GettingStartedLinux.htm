      <p>This version of the tutorial is for the 0.9 release of leJOS NXJ. </p>
      <a name="1"></a>
      <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
      
      <a name="2"></a>
      <h5>Java Development Kit</h5>     
      
      <p>You will also need a Java Development Kit (JDK) on your PC. 
      Note that a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not sufficient 
      as it does not allow you to compile Java programs. You can download
      the latest JDK from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/</a>.
      Follow the instructions for installing it. leJOS NXJ works has been
      tested with JDK versions 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7, and will not work with earlier
      versions. JDK 1.6 or 1.7 is recommended. Note that leJOS has only
      been tested with the official Oracle JDK. It is likely to work with the Open JDK, but not with gcj.</p>
      
      <p>leJOS NXJ needs to know the locations of java.exe and javac.exe. There are several possibilities
      to achieve that: (1) add the bin directory of the JDK to your <em>PATH</em> environment variable
      so that commands such as <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> can be called from a command prompt
      or (2) set the <em>LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME</em> environment variable to the directory of an installed JDK.
      The <em>JAVA_HOME</em> environment variable can also be used instead of LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME.
      If you do not know how to modify environment variables, read the "Setting up environment variables"
      section below.</p>
 
      <a name="3"></a>
      <h5>USB Driver</h5>  
      
      <p>In order to use a USB connection to your NXT brick on Linux, libusb must be installed.
      It can be obtained from <a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://libusb.sourceforge.net</a>.
      It is pre-installed with many Linux distributions, or is available as an optional package.</p>
               
      <p>You will need to ensure that the packages that leJOS NXJ is dependent on are on your system. 
      To build the jlibnxt JNI library, which is used for USB access, you need the
      <em>Development files for libusb</em>. The package is usally called something like
      <em>libusb-devel</em>.  
      Note that either libusb-0.1 or libusb-compat is required. The newer libusb-1.0 will not work.</p>
      
		<p>If you are running leJOS NXJ from a non-root user, you will need to ensure that you have
		read and write access the NXT USB device in /dev/bus/usb. You can temporary allow access to
		certain USB decives using the following command:</p>

		<p><code>sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/xxx/yyy</code></p>

		<p>The <code>xxx</code> and <code>yyy</code> numbers need for you NXT to be determined
		beforehand. The number will change each time the NXT is disconnected and reconnected
		or turned off and on again.</p>

		<p>A better solution is to use <em>udev rules</em>. How to do this may vary with different Linux
		systems. To use <em>udev rules</em>, set up a file such as <em>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules</em>
		and populate it with the following lines:</p>

		<pre class="CodeBox"><code># Lego NXT brick in normal mode
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", DRIVER=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0694", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0002", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"
# Lego NXT brick in firmware update mode (Atmel SAM-BA mode)
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", DRIVER=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6124", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660"</code></pre>

		<p>These rules rely on your username being in the <em>lego</em> usergroup. You may have to create
		this usergroup via <code>sudo groupadd lego</code> and then add your username to the group via
		<code>sudo gpasswd -a &lt;username&gt; lego</code>. You can also modify the file to your requirements.
		On recent Linux system, the rules are reloaded automatically by udev.
		The rules can be reloaded manually using the command <code>sudo udevadm control --reload-rules</code>.</p>

      <h5>Bluetooth</h5> 
      <p>If you want to communicate with the NXT over Bluetooth, you will need a Linux supported
      Bluetooth dongle or built-in support on your PC. leJOS uses the Bluecove libraries which are
      included in the distribution. You can use leJOS NXJ without Bluetooth.</p>

      <h4>Installing leJOS</h4>
      
      <a name="8"></a>
      <h5>Downloading the software</h5> 
      <p>You can download the leJOS NXJ software from <a href="http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxj-downloads.php"
      target="_blank">The leJOS NXJ download page</a>.</p>
      <p>The Linux edition of leJOS is distributed as a .tar.gz file.
      Untar the archive to a location of your choice, e.g. /opt/leJOS_NXJ</p>

      <a name="10"></a>
      <h5>Setting up environment variables</h5>
      <p>leJOS NXJ needs to know the locations of java.exe and javac.exe. There are several possibilities
      to achieve that: (1) add the bin directory of the JDK to your <em>PATH</em> environment variable
      so that commands such as <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> can be called from a command prompt
      or (2) set the <em>LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME</em> environment variable to the directory of an installed JDK.
      Note that you can use <em>JAVA_HOME</em> instead of LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME, however setting JAVA_HOME might
      intefere with other applications.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the <em>NXJ_HOME</em> variable should be set to the directory where leJOS NXJ
      is installed. It allows other applications, e.g. the Ant scripts, to locate the leJOS
      Development Kit. Also, for easy exececution of the leJOS commands on the command line,
      the bin folder of the leJOS distribution should be added to the <em>PATH</em> variable.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <table border="1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><b>Variable</b></td>
            <td><b>Value</b></td>
            <td><b>Examples</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>NXJ_HOME</td>
            <td>The folder you installed leJOS NXJ into</td>
            <td>/opt/leJOS_NXJ</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME</td>
            <td>The folder where the JDK is installed</td>
            <td>/opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.30<br/>
            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.06</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PATH</td>
            <td>Prepend the bin of the leJOS Development Kit</td>
            <td>/opt/leJOS_NXJ/bin:$PATH</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The bin directory for the JDK may already be on your PATH. In that case, it is unnecessary
      to set LEJOS_NXT_JAVA_HOME or JAVA_HOME, unless you want to have multiple JDKs on your system
      and want to select a specific JDK for use with leJOS.</p>
      <p>With most Linux distributions, you can set these environment variables for the current user
      in .bash_profile or for all users in /etc/profile.</p>
      
      <a name="11"></a>
      <h5>Building the release</h5>
      
      <p>In order to use USB communications, you have to build the java native library first.
      In order to do that, change directory to $NXJ_HOME/build and type <code>ant</code>.
      If you have the dependent packages installed the release should build without errors.</p>
         
      <a name="12"></a>     
      <h5>Flashing the Firmware</h5>
      
      <p>As leJOS NXJ is a firmware replacement, you will need to flash the firmware to your NXT. 
      Note that this will overwrite any existing firmware. If you have the standard LEGO firmware
      or other third-party firmware on your NXT, existing files will be lost.</p>
      
      <p>Note that the 0.9 release changes the amount of flash memory reserved for the firmware
      and the startup menu, so when you first flash the 0.9 firmware any existing files will be lost</p>
      
      <p>Make sure your NXT is attached to the PC via USB cable and switch it on by pressing the
      orange button. Open a command line prompt and either type the command <code>nxjflash</code>
      or <code>nxjflashg</code>. The latter starts the GUI version of nxjflash.</p> 
      
      <p>If you chose <code>nxjflash</code> to flash the leJOS NXJ firmware, you will see
      some messages on your command window.
      If the NXT brick is already in firmware update mode (it makes a ticking noise), then
      the firmware will be uploaded immediately. Otherwise, if your NXT has a previous version of
      the leJOS or LEGO firmware on it, a list of the NXTs connected to the USB will be shown 
      and you will be asked to input the number in the list of the NXT you want updated - this will
      be 1 if a single NXT is connected to your PC. After the flashing procedure has finished, you
      should see the leJOS logo on your NXT and hear the leJOS startup sound.
      If your NXT has other firmware on it, or if <code>nxjflash</code> fails, you must manually
      put your NXT into firmware update mode. Press the reset button (at the back of the NXT,
      hidden in the hole near the USB port) for more than 4 seconds. A straightened paper clip could
      be useful for this. Your NXT will audibly tick when it is firmware update mode. 
      Then try <code>nxjflash</code> again.</p>
      
      <p>If you chose <code>nxjflashg</code>, the GUI version of nxjflash will start.
      When the program window opens, click on Start Program and follow the instructions.
