		<h4>Installing Eclipse</h4>
		<p>You can download Eclipse from <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse
		downloads</a>. If you are only going to use Eclipse for leJOS NXJ
		programs, you will only need standard Java development capabilities -
		you will not need a version that supports the Java Enterprise Edition
		or other languages such as C++ or Eclipse plugin development. A
		package such as "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is sufficient for
		leJOS NXJ. Make sure you download a package for your operating system.
		Note, however that for Windows, even if you are on a 64-bit system,
		you need a 32-bit version of Eclipse, for leJOS NXJ. The examples in
		this section are for Microsoft Windows, but the installation process
		is similar for other operating systems. If you are using Linux, your
		distribution may have its own Eclipse package, which you may prefer to
		use.</p>
		<p>Unzip the package you downloaded to a folder. If you extract
		all files to C:\ then your Eclipse folder will be C:\eclipse.</p>
		<p>You can start Eclipse by running eclipse.exe from your Eclipse
		folder. You may want to put a shortcut to eclipse.exe on your desktop.</p>
		<p>When you first start Eclipse, you are asked to select a
		workspace:</p>
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_main00.png" />
		<p>You can leave this as the default, or you can work with
		multiple workspaces and create one just for your leJOS projects.</p>

		<p>When you click OK, the IDE will open and you will see a welcome
		screen. After closing the Welcome window, Eclipse will look like this:</p>
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_main01.png" />

		<p>The tutorial takes you through installing the leJOS plug-in,
		creating your own NXT and PC leJOS project, and running the NXT samples and PC
		samples that come with leJOS.</p>

		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

		<h4>Installing the Eclipse plugin</h4>

		<p>The preferred way of setting up a project for leJOS with Eclipse
		is to use the leJOS Eclipse plugin. The plugin will allow you to create
		NXT projects for writing Java programs that run on the NXT itself
		and PC projects for writing Java program that remote control the NXT
		via USB or Bluetooth.</p>
		<p>To install the leJOS, click on the Help menu and select
		"Install New Software..." as shown below.</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_update00.png" />

		<p>When you see the following dialog you type
		"http://lejos.sourceforge.net/tools/eclipse/plugin/nxj/"
		in the field labeled "Work with:". Then hit enter. Eclipse will check the update site
		and show a list of available components:</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_update05.png" />

		<p>Chose to install the leJOS plug-in and click the Next button. Click through
		the next few pages of the Install dialog and eventually click on Finish.
		Eclipse will now download the plug-in. The leJOS plug-in is not signed and
		the following warning will appear:</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_update09.png" />

		<p>Click on OK and Eclipse will continue with installing the plug-in:</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_update10.png" />

		<p>Wait until you are prompted to restart Eclipse:</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_update12.png" />

		<p>Click on "Restart Now" and Eclipse will restart.</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_main02.png" />
				
		<p>Notice the new button with the leJOS icon in the toolbar. You can read the plugin help by
		select clicking on the Help menu and selecting "Help Contents and then
		"leJOS NXJ".</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_help02.png" />

		<p>It is a good idea to read the help page to familiarize yourself
		with the plugin.</p>
		 
		<p>To Configure the plugin for your system and preferences, click
		on the "Window" menu and select Preferences and then "leJOS NXJ".</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_prefs01.png" />

		<p>Browse to where you installed leJOS NXJ and select it as
		NXJ_HOME. Select any other options you require. It is a good idea to
		check the "Verbose" option.
		Note, that these setting are the <em>defaults</em> for the created Run Configurations.
		See below on how to edit them.</p>

		<p>When you have set your preferences, click on "Apply" and then
		"OK".</p>

		<p>The plugin is now set up and ready to use.</p>

		<p>You can upload the leJOS NXJ firmware to your NXT brick from the
		plugin, by clicking on the "leJOS NXJ" menu item and selecting "Upload
		Firmware" or by clicking on the leJOS button on the toolbar.
		That will start the NXJFlash utility.</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_firmware.png" />

		<p>To create a new leJOS NXJ project using the plugin, go the "File" menu
		and select "New" and then "Project..."" as shown below:</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project00.png" />

		<a name="8"></a>
		<h4>Creating your own NXT project</h4>

		<p>Open the new project wizard as explained above.
		Unfold the LeJOS category and select "LeJOS NXT Project" as shown below:</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt00.png" />

		<p>This will open the wizard for creating new leJOS NXT projects:</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt01.png" />

		<p>Enter the name of the project and click Finish.
		Back in the main window of Eclipse, you will see your new project. Note, that
		the classes.jar (which replaces the Java Runtime) is already included in the
		projects build path. Also note the small leJOS icon next to the project's name.
		This indicates that the project is for NXT programs only.</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt05.png" />

		<p>Now right click the src folder and select "New" and then "Class" in the context menu
		as shown below:</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt06.png" />

		<p>This will open the wizard for creating new Java classes:</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt07.png" />

		<p>Enter a package name and the a the name of the class. In the example,
		the class name HelloWorld has been chosen. The package name <code>com.mydomain</code>
		corresponds to the DNS domain "mydomain.com". Make sure to chose appropriate names.
		Typically, the package name consist of a DNS domain name in reverse order followed
		by the name of the project, for example.</p>
		
		<p>Once you click Finish, the editor for the class will open.
		Now you can start programming. The example in the screenshot shows the following code:</p>
		
		<pre class="CodeBox"><code>package com.mydomain;

import lejos.nxt.Button;

public class HelloWorld {
    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        Button.waitForAnyPress();
    }
}</code></pre>

		<p>The program will print "Hello World!" on the NXT's LCD screen and wait for any Button
		to be pressed. Of course you can add further classes and packages to your project.</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt09.png" />

		<p>When you are ready to upload your program to the brick,
		right-click on the class which contains the <code>main</code> method.
		Select "Run As"&rarr;"LeJOS NXT Program" in the context menu.</p>
		
		<p><b>Note:</b> do not select "Run As"&rarr;"Java Application" since this will try
		start the program locally, with a normal Java virtual machine and a normal Java runtime.
		It will not work and almost certainly result in an error.</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt10.png" />

		<p>You will see output on a leJOS NXJ Console. Also note, that two additional files
		have been created in the project root directory. The nxj file is the one being upload
		to the NXT brick. The nxd is for debugging purposes.</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_nxt11.png" />

		<p>If you selected the "Run program after upload" option,
		the program will start running on your NXT when
		it has finished uploaing.</p>

		<a name="8b"></a>
		<h4>Creating your own PC project</h4>
		
		<p>Open the new project wizard as explained above.
		Unfold the LeJOS category and select "LeJOS PC Project" as shown below:</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc00.png" />

		<p>This will open the wizard for creating new leJOS PC projects:</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc01.png" />

		<p>Enter the name of the project and click Finish.
		Back in the main window of Eclipse, you will see your new project. Note, that
		the JAR files like pccomm.jar etc. and their dependencies are already included in the
		projects build path. Note, that PC projects don't have the small leJOS icon next
		to the projects name.</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc05.png" />

		<p>Now right click the src folder and select "New" and then "Class" in the context menu
		as shown below:</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc06.png" />

		<p>This will open the wizard for creating new Java classes:</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc07.png" />

		<p>Enter a package name and the a the name of the class. In the example,
		the class name HelloWorld has been chosen. The package name <code>com.mydomain</code>
		corresponds to the DNS domain "mydomain.com". Make sure to chose appropriate names.
		Typically, the package name consist of a DNS domain name in reverse order followed
		by the name of the project, for example.</p>
		
		<p>Once you click Finish, the editor for the class will open.
		Now you can start programming. The example in the screenshot shows the following code:</p>
		
		<pre class="CodeBox"><code>package com.mydomain;

import lejos.nxt.Motor;

public class HelloWorld {
    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        Motor.A.forward();
    }
}</code></pre>

		<p>The program will print "Hello World!" locall on the PC. Then it will
		try to connect to any NXT and will start the Motor connected to Port A.
		Of course you can add further classes and packages to your project.</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc09.png" />

		<p>When you are ready to run your program,
		right-click on the class which contains the <code>main</code> method.
		Select "Run As"&rarr;"Java Application" in the context menu.</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc10.png" />

		<p>You will see output on the local console in Eclipse. Note the line
		after the "Hello World!" which indicates that the program connected
		to an NXT brick.</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_project_pc11.png" />

		<a name="8c"></a>
		<h4>Editing Run Configurations</h4>
		
		<p>When chosing launching a LeJOS NXT Program or a Java Application in Eclipse, a
		so-called Run Configuration is created. It can be edited in order to change certain
		parameters. In the example below, the verbose linking is enabled for a specific 
		Run Configuration. First select the "Run"&rarr;"Run Configurations..." in the menu:</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_runconf00.png" />
		
		<p>The following dialog will open. Select the Run Configuration you want to change:</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_runconf03.png" />
		
		<p>After making the changes, click "Apply" and then "Run" or "Close".
		After enabling the verbose linking, the output in the console window when uploading
		a program to the NXT will change:</p>
		
		<pre class="CodeBox"><code>Linking ...

		<p>The additional information will allow you to decipher the numeric stack traces
		which occur on the LCD screen of the NXT when an exception happens.</p>

		<a name="2"></a>
		<h4>Importing the samples and examples into Eclipse</h4>

		<p>The plugin offers an import wizard to import the sample- and example-projects
		that come with leJOS into Eclipse. Select "File"&rarr;"Import..." in the menu.</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_import00.png" />
		
		<p>Unfold the General category and select "leJOS samples and project templates".</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_import01.png" />
		
		<p>Click Next, and you will see the following dialog, which allows you to chose
		which projects to import. Note, that you cannot import a project, if a project
		with the same name already exists in the workspace.</p>
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_import02.png" />
		
		<p>After clicking Finish, the imported projects will appear in the main window.</p>		
		
		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_import03.png" />
		
		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>

		<a name="3"></a>
		<h4>Using the NXT samples project</h4>

		<p>Unfold the samples project, and right-click the sample you want to start.
		You must select class which contains the <code>main</code> method. If you don't
		know, right-click the package instead.
		Select "Run As"&rarr;"LeJOS NXT Program" and the sample will be linked and uploaded to
		the NXT brick.</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_samples03.png" />
		
		<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<a name="4"></a>
		<h4>Using the PC samples project</h4>
		
		<p>Unfold the pcsamples project, and right-click the sample you want to start.
		You must select class which contains the <code>main</code> method. If you don't
		know, right-click the package instead.
		Select "Run As"&rarr;"Java Application" and the sample will be started.</p>

		<img class="screenshot" src="ecl_pcsamples03.png" />
		
		<p><a href="#top">Back	to top</a></p>
		
		<a name="5"></a>
		<h4>Using the example projects</h4>

		<p>The example projects are a good example of how to create an
		Eclipse project for leJOS that also includes an Ant build file.
		Beside the build.xml, the projects are identical to the ones
		created by the project wizards described above.</p>
		
		<p>org.lejos.example is an example of a project for NXT-side programs and hence
		the build.xml includes targets for linking and uploading the program.
		org.lejos.pcexample is an example of a project for PC-side programs
		that remote control the NXT. The Ant script automatically includes
		all JAR files necessary to do that in the project's classpath.</p>
		
		<p>To use them as a template, import them as described above and
		rename the project. It is good practice to include the name of your organization in
		the project name to avoid name clashes with other projects in the work
		space. However if you are the only user of a project, this is not
		necessary. Then edit the build.properties file, which contains all
		important parameters, e.g. the name of the main class.</p>

		<p>In order to try the Ant script from within Eclipse, right-click on build.xml
		and select "RunAs"&rarr;"Ant Build". In case of the example project, you
		should see the verbose output from the linker in the Eclipse console window and
		the binary will be uploaded to the NXT and run.</p>

		<p>If you want to run a different ant target, right-click on
		build.xml and select "Run As"&rarr;"Ant Build...".</p>

		<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
		
		<a name="9"></a>
		<h4>Setting up the leJOS GUI Tools</h4>
		<p>leJOS NXJ comes with a set of GUI tools that can be using for
		flashing the firmware, exploring files on the NXT, monitoring and
		debugging programs on the NXT, downloading data logs, etc. It is
		useful to be able to run these tools within Eclipse, and to do this
		you need to set them up as external tools.</p>
		<p>To create external tools click on the down array next to the
		Run External Tools Icon on the toolbar and select "External Tools
		Configuration":</p>
		<img class="screenshot" src="eclipseexternal.jpg" />
		<p>Then select Program and click on the New Launch Configuration
		button and you should see:</p>
		<img class="screenshot" src="eclipseconfiguration.jpg" />
		<p>Type the name of your configuration, such as NXJ Flash and
		click on Browse File System and find the bin directory of where you
		installed leJOS NXJ and select nxjflashg.bat.</p>

		<p>If you have multiple installations of leJOS you can go to the
		Environment tab and set NXJ_HOME to the one you wish to use.</p>

		<p>Other GUI tools you should set up include:</p>
		<ul class="BlueArrows">
			<li>nxjbrowse - an Explorer for NXJ files</li>
			<li>nxjconsoleviewer - GUI viewer for RConsole debug output</li>
			<li>nxjmonitor - Remote monitoring of programs running on the
			NXT</li>
			<li>nxjdataviewer - GUI tool to download data logs from NXT</li>
			<li>nxjcontrol - a GUI tool that combines the function of all of the above tool, and adds a few more functions.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You may also want to set up command line tools such as:</p>
		<ul class="BlueArrows">
			<li>nxjflash - command line firmware flash tool</li>
			<li>nxjconsole - command line viewer for RConsole debugging	output</li>
			<li>nxjsocketproxy - proxy for communicating with PC and Internet program using sockets</li>
		</ul>
