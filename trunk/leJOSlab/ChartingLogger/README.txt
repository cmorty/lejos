version ??? (I really need to figure out a good versioning system)

ChartingLogger.jar is the PC-side ChartLogger application. All dependencies _should_ be included. Built with leJOS 
snapshot classes/firmware 0.9 as of 6/1/11.

run with "java -jar ChartLogger.jar" at cmd prompt. Sample sine dataset is displayed.
NXT sample TestLogger.java located at \lejos\trunk\leJOSlab\ChartingLogger\nxt\src\net\mosen\nxt\instrumentation.

Please report anything you deem reportable to lejos@mosen.net. Comments, suggestions, constructive criticism always
welcome.

You will need JFreeCHart 1.0.13. Go to http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/. I included the classes in the 
ChartingLogger.jar but the download from jfree.org provides source, etc. (What a developer craves! It's got 
electrolytes!)

Chart management:
Zoom extents: Doubleclick or click-drag to left, and/or up
Zoom window: CLick-drag (to right and down) release
Slider changes domain scale dynamically from 0.1 to 100% of (domain) X dataset extents/range
Tootip: Hover over data point and series name, x-y val is shown
left-click moves crosshair to nearest x-y datapoint. Displays coordinate in lower rigth of chart
