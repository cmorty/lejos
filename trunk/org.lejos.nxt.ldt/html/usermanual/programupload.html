<h1>Uploading a leJOS NXJ program to the NXT brick</h1>
To link and upload a leJOS NXJ program to the NXT brick, perform the following steps:
<ol>
	<li>In the <b>Package Explorer</b> of the Java perspective, select the .java file that contains the program's main class 
	and open its context menu.</li>
	<li>Navigate to the <em>leJOS NXJ</em> menu and select <em>Upload program to the NXT brick</em>. The required classes will be linked 
	and uploaded to the NXT brick.
	<br>Note that the verbosity of this feature (including logging of the signatures of the classes that get uploaded to the brick)
	can be enhanced by checking the <em>verbose</em> box of the <em>leJOS NXJ</em> <a href="configuration.html">preferences page</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Use the leJOS menu on the brick to run the program.</li> 
</ol>  
Note; if some error occurs, consult Eclipse's <b>Console</b> view for details.
