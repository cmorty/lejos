		<title>leJOS NXJ Eclipse Plug-In: Creating a leJOS NXJ project</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Creating a leJOS NXJ project</h1>
		<p>The plugin provides two kinds of projects:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>LeJOS NXT Projects</li>
			<li>LeJOS PC Project</li>
		</ul>
		<p>LeJOS NXT projects allow you to write and upload Java programs to the Lego NXT brick.
		You know whether your project is a LeJOS NXT project, if the little leJOS icon is attached to your project.</p>
		<p>LeJOS PC projects allow you to write Java programs, that run locally on your PC but can remote control
		the NXT brick via USB or Bluetooth.</p>
		<p>To create a new LeJOS project (either NXT or PC), select <em>File&rarr;New&rarr;Project...</em>
		from the main menu bar. Now, unfold the leJOS categroy and select the project type you want.
		Type in the name of the Project, make all the adjustments you'd like to make, and click Finish.</p>
		<p>There may be projects created with an old version of the plugin. You may convert them to
		new-style LeJOS NXT projects by selecting <em>leJOS NXJ&rarr;Convert to leJOS NXJ project</em>
		in the project's context menu.</p>
		<p>There is no automatic conversion for old-style LeJOS PC projects. To convert them,
		edit the build path of the project, and use the "Add Library..." Button to add
		the LeJOS PC libraries to the build path after removing all refernces to pccomms.jar, pctools.jar and friends.</p>
		<p><b>Warning:</b> a project intended for running on the NXT must never include the LeJOS PC libraries in its build path.
		Similarly, a project intended for being run on the PC must never include the LeJOS NXT runtime in its build path.</p>
