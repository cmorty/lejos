		<title>leJOS NXJ Eclipse Plug-In: Uploading a leJOS NXJ program to the NXT brick</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>Uploading a leJOS NXJ program to the NXT brick</h1>
		<p>Note that LeJOS PC projects are launched the normal way, just like any other Java project.</p>
		<p>To link and upload a program to the NXT brick, first make sure that
		the project is a LeJOS NXT project by checking for a little LeJOS icon
		next to the project name. If the project is not a LeJOS NXT project, or
		you haven't created a project yet, follow <a href="lejosproject.html">these</a>
		instructions. Once a LeJOS NXT project is set up, follow these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In the <b>Package Explorer</b> of the Java perspective,
			right click on the project, a package, a *.java file or a class</li>
			<li>Select <em>Run As&rarr;LeJOS NXT Program</em></li>
			<li>Eclipse might ask you to select the main class, if multiple suitable classes exist in your selection</li>
			<li>Two new files with the name of the class will appear in the root directory of the project</li>
			<li><b>Note</b> that the verbosity of this feature (including logging of the signatures of the classes that get uploaded to the brick)
			can be enhanced by checking the <em>verbose</em> box of the <em>leJOS NXJ</em> <a href="configuration.html">preferences page</a>.</li>
			<li>Use the leJOS menu on the brick to run the program.</li> 
		</ol>  
		<p>Note; if some error occurs, consult Eclipse's <b>Console</b> view for details.</p>
