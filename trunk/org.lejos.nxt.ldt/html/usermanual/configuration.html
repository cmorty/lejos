</head>

<body>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
Configuration for the Plugin takes place in the <em>leJOS NXJ</em> section of the <em>Preferences</em> page of Eclipse.<br>
Navigate there by calling <em>Window->Preferences...</em> from the menu bar of the Eclipse workbench. 
<h2>Setting NXJ_HOME</h2>
You need to set the property <b>NXJ_HOME</b> in the preference page of <em>leJOS NXJ</em>. 
Click the <em>Browse</em> button that is located right of the according text field and select the root directory of your leJOS NXJ installation in the file system.
<h2>Setting the connection type</h2>
You can choose between two types of connection between your computer and the NXT brick: <em>USB</em> and <em>Bluetooth</em>. Select the according radio button in the 
<b>Connection type</b> group.   
<h2>Verbosity</h2>
To enable enhanced verbosity of the leJOS NXJ utilities (such as logging the signatures of the classes that get uploaded to the brick), check the
<em>verbose</em> box.
<h2>Running the program immediately after the download</h2>
You can choose to run your leJOS program immediately after it has been downloaded by checking the
<em>Run program after download</em> box.
<h2>Connecting to a brick with a particular address</h2>
If you want the plugin to connect to a NXT brick with a particular address (instead of letting
it search for a connected brick), you can check the <em>Connect to address</em> box and 
specify the address of the brick is in the associated field.
<h2>Connecting to a brick with a particular name</h2>
If you want the plugin to connect to a NXT brick with a particular name (instead of letting
it search for a connected brick), you can check the <em>Connect to named brick</em> box and 
specify the name of the brick is in the associated field.
