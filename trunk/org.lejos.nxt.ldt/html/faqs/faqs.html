<h1>FAQs</h1>
<h2>When compiling my classes, I get an error stating that some leJOS classes can not be found.</h2>
Make sure that <em>NXJ_HOME</em> is set in the
the <em>leJOS NXJ</em> section of the <em>Preferences</em> page of Eclipse and that you have converted the project 
to a leJOS project. 
<h2>When trying to upload my main class to the brick, I get an error stating that the communication classes 
can not be instantiated.</h2>
This is due to the fact that the native comm driver library can not be loaded. Make sure that 
the environment variable <em>NXJ_HOME</em> is set and that <em>%NXJ_HOME%\bin</em> resp. <em>$NXJ_HOME/bin</em> 
is included in your system class path.
