# DESCRIPTION:
#
# This file is used temporaly to define some variables to be used in
# a node developed with the stack nxt_lejos_ros for ROS.
# http://www.ros.org/wiki/nxt_lejos_ros
#
# Currently .launch files for ROSJava doesn't have the feature to pass
# variables to nodes so it is necessary to define an alternative to 
# solve the problem.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# When a developer has to use the package NXTLoader, it is necessary to
# save this file in the path: ~/.ros/
# 
# PARAMETERS:
# Parameters used with NXTLoader are:
#
# - NXT-BRICK: NXT Brick used to connect
# - CONNECTION-TYPE: The way to connect. USB | BLUETOOTH
# - YAML-ROBOT-DESCRIPTOR: YAML file used to define your NXT robot

NXT-BRICK = dog
CONNECTION-TYPE = BLUETOOTH
YAML-ROBOT-DESCRIPTOR  = NXT.yaml

# Local differential navigation variables
DIFFERENTIAL_NAVIGATION_FEATURES = true
WHEEL_DIAMETER = 4.96
TRACK_WIDTH = 13.0
REVERSE = false

ACCELERATION = 4000
# cm/sec
TRAVEL_SPEED = 20
# deg/sec
ROATE_SPEED = 180
