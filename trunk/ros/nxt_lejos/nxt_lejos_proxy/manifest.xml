  <description brief="nxt_lejos_proxy">
      The nxt_lejos_proxy package communicates with a leJOS NXT robot running
      the ROS Responder. It works over USB or Bluetooth.  The proxy publishes
      sensor messages for all sensors in the "nxt_robot" configuration 
      parameters.  It also publishes tf transforms and odometry data. 
      It subscribes to the cmd_vel topic with a Twist message to allow the
      robot to be controlled by the ROS navigation stack. It also subscribes
      to other topics that allow the robot to be controlled with pilot 
      commands and allow tones to be played on the robot. It is much faster
      than nxt_lejos_lcp_proxy.
