  <description brief="leJOS ROS API and navigation support">
  The nxt_lejos stack provides a ROS API for leJOS NXT robots. There are two versions of the API: 
  nxt_lejos_proxy and nxt_lejos_lcp_proxy. The nxt_lejos_proxy package is much faster and more up to date,
  but it requires a leJOS ROS Responder program to be running on the NXT. The API uses a robot configuration, 
  similar to that used by the nxt stack, to describe the NXT robot and specify which sensors are published
  on which topics, at what frequency, and also the tf frames that are used for each robot joint and sensor. There is also a set of
  topics available to control the robot, or individual motors, and to play tones etc. There is support for the 
  navigation stack and rviz: tf, odom and pose are published, and cmd_vel (Twist messages) and initialpose 
  are supported. There is a package (nxt_lejos_navigation) that provides navigation stack launch and
  parameter files. There is support for leJOS map fles - see the nxt_lejos_map_server package.
