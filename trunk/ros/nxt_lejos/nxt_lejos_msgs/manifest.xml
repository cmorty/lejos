  <description brief="nxt_lejos_msgs">
   The nxt_lejos_msgs package includes extra messages, in addition to those in nxt_msgs, used by the nxt_lejos stack.
   It includes messages that report the state of sensors, messages to control the robot,
   messages to control individual motors, and a message that allows tones to be played by the NXT brick.
