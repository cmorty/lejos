THE NETBEANS PLUGIN

This plugin gives Netbeans the ability to easily open a sample NXJ project
that you can as the starting point for your work.  
You can use many of the Netbeans short cuts that are available in the standard Java projects.
Open a sample project  by using  File/New Project.  Click on Samples and 
you will see the icon for NXJ project.  Select it,  click next and enter your project name.  

The sample project contains a sample main class as a starting point for your project development.

HOW TO INSTALL THE PLUGIN.

In Tools > Plugins  click on the Downloaded tab, click on Add Plugins and
find NXJPlugin/build/nxjplugin.nbm.   Click on it, and it will be installed.

HOW TO UPDATE THE PLUGIN

The nxjplugin.nbm file is generated by the NXJPlugin project and put in the build folder.
The source file it uses is src/nxjplugin/NXJSampleProject.zip
The easiest way to modify this zip file is
1. Open the org.lejos.example project  and the NXJPlugin project in Netbeans.
2. Make the desired changes in the NxjTemplate.  
   You can make any changes you wish in src. 
   You can also edit build.xml  and build.properties.
3. Run the  Netbeans zip  target in build.xml   This will update NXJSampleProject.zip  in NXJPlugin.src.
4. In Project view, right click on the NXJPlugin project and select Install/reload in Development IDE
   You can now open a sample NXJ project (it will appear in Sample) and test it.
5. Right click NXJPlugin icon and click Create NBM.  The new nxjplugin,lbm file will be in NXJPlugin/build.
