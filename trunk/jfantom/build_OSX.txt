***************************
To build the fantom JNI wrapper for OS X:
***************************

NOTE: for a release binary, you will need OS X Snow Leopard.
      Snow Leopard is the last OS X that supports building
      binaries for OS X 10.4 ppc and i386. 


*** OS X Snow Leopard

1) Install XCode from the Snow Leopard DVD.
     System Tools and Mac OS X 10.4 Support is required
     UNIX Dev Support is _not_ required

2) Install the latest Lego Fantom driver (1.1.3)

3) Download the install the SDK from
     http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/support/files/Advanced.aspx

4) Set LEJOS_NXT_OSX_FANTOMSDK environment variable

5) Run xcrun make -f Makefile.osx clean all 


*** OS X Lion

1) Install XCode (e.g. by copying Xcode.app to /Applications)

2) Setup xcode-select by running
     sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app

3) We have to override the default settings from Makefile.osx
     export LEJOS_NXT_OSX_GXX=$(xcrun -find gcc)
   and
     export LEJOS_NXT_OSX_SYSVER=10.6
     export LEJOS_NXT_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk
   or
     export LEJOS_NXT_OSX_SYSVER=10.7
     export LEJOS_NXT_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk
   An overview of the installed SDKs is available via the command
     xcodebuild -sdk -version

4) Edit Makefile.osx and remove -arch ppc

5) Continue at 2) for Snow Leopard above



Background about the fakeNiSpy hack:

On OS X, the Fantom library depends on the VISA framework,
as you can verify with
  otool -L /Library/Frameworks/Fantom.framework/Versions/1/Fantom
The VISA framework depends on the library
  /Library/Frameworks/NiSpyLog.framework/Versions/2/NiSpyLog
However, this library is a weak dependency. This can be verified via
  otool -l /Library/Frameworks/VISA.framework/Versions/A/VISA 
Weak dependencies are not required at runtime, but the linker insists to load
it. To make the linker happy, we provide the linker with a replacement for
that library via the -dylib_file parameter. Note, that the produced binary
(libjfantom.jnilib) does not seem to be affected in any way (i.e. it runs,
and the fake library does not show up in the output of otool -L or -l).

Remark: one can also install NI-VISA for Mac OS X (5.1.2 at the time of
writing) to obtain the missing NiSpyLog library.
