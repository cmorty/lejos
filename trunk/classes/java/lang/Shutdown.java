/**
 * This is an internal system class that implements the system shutdown process.
 * Classes which require some form of cleanup when the program is about to exit
 * can register a system shutdown hook which will be run via this code when the
 * system shuts down. System shutdown can be triggered by one of the following
 * 1) A call to the exit function
 * 2) The last none daemon thread exiting
 * 3) A user generated shutdown interrupt (ENTER+ESCAPE)
 * Note: Some care has been taken to minimise the impact of this code on
 * programs that do not require shutdown hooks. In particular the event wait
 * thread is not created unless a shutdown hook is in place. This means that
 * the associated collection, and collection classes will not be loaded.
