/**
 *  <p>This class creates sockets. It may be subclassed by other factories, which create particular subclasses of sockets 
 *  and thus provide a general framework for the addition of public socket-level functionality.</p>
 *  <p>Socket factories are a simple way to capture a variety of policies related to the sockets being constructed, 
 *  producing such sockets in a way which does not require special configuration of the code which asks for the sockets:</p>
 *  <li>Due to polymorphism of both factories and sockets, different kinds of sockets can be used by the same application 
 *  code just by passing it different kinds of factories.
 *  <li>Factories can themselves be customized with parameters used in socket construction. So for example, factories 
 *  could be customized to return sockets with different networking timeouts or security parameters already configured.
 *  <li>The sockets returned to the application can be subclasses of java.net.Socket, so that they can directly expose 
 *  new APIs for features such as compression, security, record marking, statistics collection, or firewall tunneling.
 *  <p>Factory classes are specified by environment-specific configuration mechanisms. For example, the getDefault 
 *  method could return a factory that was appropriate for a particular user or applet, and a framework could use a 
 *  factory customized to its own purposes.</p>
