 * This class has been designed to manage a GSV Sentence

 * GPS Satellites in View
 * 
 * eg. $GPGSV,3,1,11,03,03,111,00,04,15,270,00,06,01,010,00,13,06,292,00*74

 * 
 * 1    = Total number of messages of this type in this cycle
 * 2    = Message number
 * 3    = Total number of SVs in view
 * 4    = SV PRN number
 * 5    = Elevation in degrees, 90 maximum
 * 6    = Azimuth, degrees from true north, 000 to 359
 * 7    = SNR, 00-99 dB (null when not tracking)
 * 8-11 = Information about second SV, same as field 4-7
 * 12-15= Information about third SV, same as field 4-7
 * 16-19= Information about fourth SV, same as field 4-7
