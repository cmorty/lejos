 * Freedom Universal Bluetooth keyboard

 * iTech Virtual Keyboard (SPP only)

// TODO: Create a method that returns a stream of ASCII from keyboard. Thread handles keep alive, auto connect

// Typematic Key Repeat:
// Typematic delay - 0.25 seconds to 1.00 second (500ms default)
// Typematic rate - 2.0 cps (characters per second) to 30.0 cps (10.9 default)
// "Set Typematic Rate/Delay" (0xF3) command
// Typematic data is not buffered within the keyboard.  In the case 
// where more than one key is held down, only the last key pressed 
// becomes typematic.  Typematic repeat then stops when that key is 
// released, even though other keys may be held down.

	 * NOTE: There is no ASCII Caps Lock for 0x58. There is shift-in and shift-out, but that
	 * seems to have a different function than Caps (i.e. Caps only applies to A-Z, but shift 
	 * applies to number keys displaying symbols).
	 * Note: Scan code 0x12 is left-shift, however ASCII has shift-in (0x0F) and shift-out (0x0E) so
	 * I'm uncertain how to handle this as a stream. Will have to do some special case statements. This
	 * might not really be a factor anyway since shifts probably irrelevant to ASCII stream.
	 * Note: ASCII has "Device Control" 1-4 I'm assuming ALT and CTRL fit in here. Maybe Fn. Maybe Windows key. 
	 * Again, these might be irrelevant to ASCII stream.
	 * NOTE: Enter - equivalent to line feed? (ASCII 0x0A) Should stream
	 * send two characters: line feed and carriage return?
	 * NOTE: There are no ASCII characters for arrow keys.
