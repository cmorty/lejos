/**
 * 
 * The Pilot is theoretically there to perform vector movements, such as 
forward(), travel(100) and setHeading(90). The vehicle type should really be 
largely inconsequential to this interface (of course *implementations* like 
DifferentialPilot are vehicle specific). After all, robots are really just 
objects with vectors. As long as Pilot handles different vectors (including 
arc, which isn't a vector per se) we should be good to handle any moving 
object, no matter what the design specifics. I think we should make Pilot 
heavily vector oriented in the Javadoc language and method names.

	   * There is no guarantee that after you call these methods it is actually capable of completing the full movement.

	   *  *actual* movement occurred, to the best of the Pilot's ability. For example, if the Pilot is a walker, 
	   *  perhaps it can only move forward in increments of 5 cm. So if you tell it to move 17 cm, perhaps it only moves 
	   *  15 cm and then returns. Or maybe it can only rotate in increments of 15. It should report the actual movement 
	   *  it completed.
	   *  
	   *  Furthermore, I'm not sure if the integrity of the API is compromised with this method, since a robot that isn't
	   *  capable of moving backward might be asked to do so with this method. Will need to consider this more.
