/**
 * An activity that operates in coordination with other activities.
 * Only one activity can run at a time.
 * When an activity of a higher priority wants to run any activities
 * of a lower priority will be suppressed. Furthermore, if there is
 * already an activity of the same or lower priority running, that
 * activity will be stopped.
 * <P>
 * This is essentially an alternative  way of implementing a Behavior or
 * Subsumption architecture. It is totally distinct from the Behavior
 * and Arbitrator classes and does not use either.
 * <P>
 * It works like this:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>This class should be sub-classed and the action() method should
 * be implemented to perform the desired action. That may be to respond
 * to a change in a sensor, or it may be to cause the robot to wander
 * around (or anything else).
 * This method should call one of the pause() methods occasionally. In
 * particular if it wants to sleep or yield control it should call pause()
 * instead of sleep() or yield() or wait().
 * <LI>An application should create instances of the sub-classes as needed,
 * set their priorities by calling setPriority() and then start them
 * by calling start().
 * <LI>If an activity wants to run it should call activity.iWantToRun(), or
 * another class could call it.
 * <LI>If there is no higher priority activity
 * running when an activity  become runnable, any activities of the same or
 * lower priority will be suppressed. In addition, if an activity was not
 * already running the action() method will be called in its own thread.
 * <LI>If an activity is already running when it is run again, pause() throws
 * an InterruptedException. It can do what it wants with that. An activity that
 * is run when a sensor is activated might want to restart action() from the
 * beginning for example. A background activity might just ignore it.
 * <LI>If a higher priority activity gets to run, pause() on this activity will
 * throw a StopException. This should not be caught so that the action()
 * method exits with that exception.
 * </OL>
 * Note. A background activity should ensure that something makes it runnable
 * if it is stopped. The easiest way to do that is to override resetRunnable()
 * to call iWantToRun().
 * <P>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &#47;**
 *  * When sensor one is pressed, run the motors in some pattern.
 *  *&#47;
 * class ControlMotors extends Activity implements PortListener
 * {
 * 	public ControlMotors()
 * 	{
 * 		Port.S1.addPortListener(this);
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	&#47;**
 * 	 * Called when the sensor state changes (in some thread other than this one).
 * 	 *&#47;	
 * 	public void stateChanged(Port s, int old, int nu)
 * 	{
 * 		if (old &gt; nu)
 * 			return;
 * 
 * 		iWantToRun();
 * 	}
 *     
 * 	&#47;**
 * 	 * Encapsulates the actual activity we want to perform.
 * 	 *
 * 	 * @exception StopException if we are forcibly stopped.
 * 	 *&#47;
 * 	protected void action() throws StopException
 * 	{
 * 		boolean finished = false;
 * 		
 * 		&#47;&#47; Sit here until we are finished or we are forcibly halted.					
 * 		while (!finished)
 * 		{
 * 			try
 * 			{
 * 				&#47;&#47; spin
 * 				Motor.C.forward();
 * 				Motor.A.backward();
 * 				
 * 				&#47;&#47; Wait for 0.25 secs, may throw InterruptedException
 * 				pause(250);
 * 	        		
 * 				&#47;&#47; Forward
 * 				Motor.A.forward();
 * 
 * 				&#47;&#47; We are finished
 * 				finished = true;
 * 			} catch (InterruptedException ie)
 * 			{
 * 				&#47;&#47; pause() was interrupted. Re-start from the beginning
 * 			}
 *		}
 *	}
 * }
 *
