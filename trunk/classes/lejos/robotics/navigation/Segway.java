/**
 * <p>This class balances a two-wheeled Segway-like robot. It works with almost any construction 
 * (tall or short) such as the <a href="http://www.laurensvalk.com/nxt-2_0-only/anyway">Anyway</a> or
 * the <a href="http://www.hitechnic.com/blog/gyro-sensor/htway/">HTWay</a>. Wheel diameter is the  most
 * important construction variable, which is specified in the constructor.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>To start the robot balancing:
 * <li>1. Run the program. You will be prompted to lay it down.
 * <li>2. Lay it down (orientation doesn't matter). It will automatically calibrate the gyro sensor.
 * <li>3. When the beeping begins, stand it up vertically so it feels balanced in your hands.
 * <li>4. When the beeping stops, let go and it will begin balancing.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Alternately you can lean the robot against a wall and run the program. After the gyro 
 * calibration, the robot backs up against the wall until it falls forward. When it detects the
 * forward fall, it start the balance loop.</p>
 * 
 * <p>NOTE: In order to make the Segway move and navigate, use the SegwayPilot class.</p>
