 * The Pilot interface forms a common set of functions an implementation must offer in order to be used by higher level
 * navigation classes. The Pilot hides the details of the robots physical construction and
 * methods to control the basic movements of the robot.<p>
 * This Pilot interfaces uses the Navigation package  standard mathematical convention for angles in
 * the plane. The direction  of the X axis is 0 degrees, the direction  of
 * the Y axis is 90 degrees.  Therefore, a positive angle is a counter clockwise change of direction,
 * and a negative angle is clockwise. Angles are measured in degrees.<p>
 * Several methods allow travel in the arc of a circle with a specified radius.
 * While a negative radius does not exist in ordinary mathematics, this interface
 * uses the sign bit of the radius parameter to denote the location of the center of the
 * turning circle with respect to the direction of the robot heading.

   * If <code>turnRate</code> is negative, the center of the turning circle is on the right side of the robot.<br>
   * If <code>turnRate</code> is zero, the robot travels in a straight line
   * <p>
   * Examples of how the formula works:
   * <UL>
   * <LI><code>steer(0)</code> -> inner and outer wheels turn at the same speed, travel  straight
   * <LI><code>steer(25)</code> -> the inner wheel turns at 75% of the speed of the outer wheel, turn left
   * <LI><code>steer(100)</code> -> the inner wheel stops and the outer wheel is at 100 percent, turn left
   * <LI><code>steer(200)</code> -> the inner wheel turns at the same speed as the outer wheel - a zero radius turn.
