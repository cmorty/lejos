/**
 * This class allows communication of event data between the leJOS firmware and
 * the leJOS low level classes. It can be used to detect I/O completion, Port
 * values changing, button presses etc. To use create a class having the required
 * device type and filter (this may identify a particular port, or I/O operation).
 * Then call the waitEvent function to wait for events from the firmware. This
 * call will block until either the firmware signals an event or the timeout
 * occurs. Upon completion the eventData field will contain information about
 * the event(s) that have been reported. Events themselves are normally reset
 * by calling the associated function to read/write the associated device. If an
 * event is not cleared, it will be reported again in subsequent calls to eventWait.
 *
 *
 * <br>NOTE: This is a low level system interface and should probably not be used
 * directly by user code.
