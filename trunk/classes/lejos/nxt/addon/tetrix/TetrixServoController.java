/**HiTechnic Servo Controller abstraction. Provides <code>TetrixServo</code> instances which are used to control
 * the Tetrix servos.
 * <p>
 * Servos are driven by a PWM signal with varying pulse widths
 * contolling the rotational position of the servo actuator.
 * <p>
 * The pulse nominally ranges from 1.0 ms to 2.0 ms with 1.5 ms always being center of range. 
 * Pulse widths outside this range can be used for "overtravel" -moving the servo beyond its normal range.
 * <p>
 * A servo pulse of 1.5 ms width will typically set the servo to its "neutral" position or 45 deg., 
 * a pulse of 1.25 ms could set it to 0 deg. and a pulse of 1.75 ms to 90 deg. 
 * The physical limits and timings of the servo hardware varies between brands and models, but a 
 * general servo's angular motion will travel somewhere in the range of 90 deg. - 120 deg. and the 
 * neutral position is almost always at 1.5 ms. This is the "standard pulse servo mode" used by all hobby analog servos.
 * <p>
 * The HiTechic Servo Controller allows setting of the PWM output from 0.75 - 2.25mS. Note that some servos may hit their 
 * internal mechanical limits at each end of this range causing them to consume excessive current and <b>potentially be damaged</b>.
