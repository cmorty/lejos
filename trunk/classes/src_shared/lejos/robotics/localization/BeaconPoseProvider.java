/**
 * <p>A PoseProvider that uses beacon triangulation to pinpoint the pose (x, y, heading) of a robot. 
 * <b>The starting position of the robot must be such that it roughly points in the direction of beacon 2, with beacon 1 to the right
 * of the robot, and beacon 3 to the left.</b> This ensures that when it performs the first scan, the beacons are scanned in order
 * 1, 2, 3. After the first scan, the robot can move about on its own and will be able to scan them in any order.</p>
 * 
 * <p>After it does a scan, you will either hear a beep or a buzz. A beep means the calculation worked. A buzz means something went
 * wrong with the calculation. This could be the beacon ordering is wrong, or it didn't scan three beacons in, or
 * the calculated beacon pose deviated significantly from the estimated odometry pose. In this case, the results are thrown out,
 * the odometry pose is used, and it will try another scan after the next move. If you hear a lot of buzzes in a row, it probably
 * means it will not recover.</p>  
 * 
 * <p>The class uses an OdometryPoseProvider internally for three reasons: 
 * <li>1. To serve as a backup pose provider if the BeaconLocator detects less than 3 beacons, or greater than 3 (meaning 
 * a false reflection occurred).
 * <li>2. It is time consuming to scan beacons after every move. Instead, this will scan about every 5 moves. In between
 * these scans, it uses the OdometryPoseProvider to navigate.
 * <li>3. It is essential to scan the beacons in order. This allows it to determine the identity of each beacon so they are
 * properly fed to the equations. The OdometryPoseProvider keeps track of heading so it knows which beacons were scanned.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The downside of using an OdometryPoseProvider to assist with detecting pose is that the robot needs to be placed
 * with an approximate heading prior to first scan. Also, if the robot is moved at any time (lifted and placed with a different 
 * heading), it probably will no longer be able to identify the beacons and become hopelessly lost. As long as the wheels are
 * always on the ground, this should not happen.</p>

	 * DEV NOTES: Possible improvements:
	 * 1. TODO: It is subjective and arbitrary for the programmer to say to it, "Do a beacon scan after every X moves." How do 
	 * I know 5 is the right amount? If I use distance, who is to say 200 cm is the right amount to allow odometry before 
	 * doing another scan? It would be nice if it somehow had a model of potential error building up, and did a scan when 
	 * the potential error got too high.
	 * TODO: Alt constructor that allows distance to determine when it does scan. Accepts double val.

	// Keeps going until it has coordinates of three beacons figured out. Optimally this would be included in BeaconTriangle 
	// in most or all code. 
	// Also add methods for saving and loading beacon coordinates to flash memory, then could call this after it has located 
	// them, and load them in before next trial.
	
	// 3. TODO: Could also do a sanity check on beacon pose calculation to see if x, y is within say 100 cm of odometry
	//  pose estimate. If not, then probably a false beacon was scanned and a true beacon was missed (rare) which resulted in it 
	// thinking it successfully scanned in 3 actual beacons. In this case, it should go with odometry.
