To build the examples under Eclipse, do the following:

- Get the SVN plug-in
- Checkout the nxtvm project 
- Checkout and build the jtools project
- Checkout and build the classes project
- Checkout and build the example project

You can then add a new example - see below.

Instructions for running the examples is also given below.

Get the SVN plug-in
-------------------

Get the SVN plug-in for Eclipse, if you do not have it already.

See http://sourceforge.net/docman?group id=178176

Checkout the nxtvm project
--------------------------

Get it from from https://svn.sourceforge.net/svntoot/lejos/trunk/nxtvm.

You do not need to build it if you are not doing VM devlopment.

It is needed by the build of jtools.

Checkout and build the jtools project
-------------------------------------

Get it from https://svn.sourceforge.net/svntoot/lejos/trunk/jtools.

To build it, right click on build.xml and select RunAs Ant Build.

The jtools project needs nxtvm to be present as it uses classes.db and signatures.db
from that project.

Checkout and build the classes project
--------------------------------------

Get it from https://svn.sourceforge.net/svntoot/lejos/trunk/classes.

To build it, right click on build.xml and select RunAs Ant Build.

Checkout the examples project
-----------------------------

Get it from https://svn.sourceforge.net/svntoot/lejos/trunk/classes.

You need to build each example separately. Note that the build
relies on the jtools and classes project being present and under the
same directory (e.g. workspace) as examples.

To build each example, right click on its build.xml file and select RunAs Ant Build.

Adding a new example
--------------------

Create a folder for the example.

Under the project's properties Java Build path, Source tab, and the new folder.

Create the Java classes for the example.

Copy a build.xml file from one of the other examples, e.g. HelloWorld, 
and change the program name in 3 places (one is a comment).

To build the example, right click on its build.xml file and select RunAs Ant Build.

Running an example
------------------

To run and example, you need the runjava utility and the SAMBA RAM
version of the lejos VM.

Windows users can get these from the snapshot project at 
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svntoot/lejos/trunk/snapshot.
They are runjava.exe and lejos_nxt.bin. You can also get built example files
from this snapshot (e.g. View.bin).

Linux users can get the source of libnxt (which includes runjava), from
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svntoot/lejos/trunk/libnxt and
build is using scons.

Linux users with an arm toolchain can build nxtvm,
by going to the platform/nxt directory and typing make.

Once you have runjava, you can run:

runjava lejos_nxt.bin MyExample.bin

(Note for Linux users: lejos_nxt.bin is built as lejos_nxt_samba_ram.bin).
