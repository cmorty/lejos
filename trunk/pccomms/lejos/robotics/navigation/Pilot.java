   * <p>
   * The <code>turnRate</code> specifies the sharpness of the turn, between -200 and +200.<br>

   * <I>Formula:</I> <code>ratio = 100 - abs(turnRate)</code>.<br>
   * When the ratio is negative, the outer and inner wheels rotate in
   * opposite directions.
   * <p>
   * If <code>turnRate</code> is positive, the center of the turning circle is on the left side of the robot.<br>
   * If <code>turnRate</code> is negative, the center of the turning circle is on the right side of the robot.<br>
   * If <code>turnRate</code> is zero, the robot travels in a straight line
   * <p>
   * Examples of how the formula works:
   * <UL>
   * <LI><code>steer(0)</code> -> inner and outer wheels turn at the same speed, travel  straight
   * <LI><code>steer(25)</code> -> the inner wheel turns at 75% of the speed of the outer wheel, turn left
   * <LI><code>steer(100)</code> -> the inner wheel stops and the outer wheel is at 100 percent, turn left
   * <LI><code>steer(200)</code> -> the inner wheel turns at the same speed as the outer wheel - a zero radius turn.
   * </UL>
   * <p>
   * Note: If you have specified a drift correction in the constructor it will not be applied in this method.
   *
