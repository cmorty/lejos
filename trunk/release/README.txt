leJOS NXJ 0.9 release
=====================

What is leJOS NXJ?
------------------

leJOS NXJ allows you to program your LEGO Mindstorms NXT robotics system in Java. To do this you must 
replace the LEGO supplied firmware, with the leJOS NXJ firmware, which includes a Java Virtual machine (JVM).

leJOS NXJ comes with many tools for building, uploading and debuggging Java programs. They are usually
used from a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). lEJOS NXJ includes plug-ins for
the Eclipse and Netbeans IDEs, but can also be used from other IDEs. If you prefer, you can just
use a Programmer's editor and command line tools.

What is the correct download for my system?
-------------------------------------------

On Windows, you should download leJOS_NXJ_0.9.0-Setup.exe from the leJOS-NXJ-win32/0.9.0beta folder.
This should be the default download from a Windows system. leJOS NXJ is supported on Windows 2000, XP, 
Vista and 7 are supported, but not earlier versions.

Before you run the installer, you should make sure you have a Java JDK installed on your PC, and its 
bin folder is on the PATH. To check this, open a command window and type "javac -version". It it gives 
you the version of your JDK and it is a version 1.5 or 1.6 JDK, you are good to go.

If you have problems with the the installer, you can try the zip file. It contains a README.html file
that includes installation instructions.

If you are on a Linux or MAC OS X system, you should download the lejos_NXJ_0_9_0beta.tar.gz file from
the leJOS-NXJ/0.9.0beta folder. This should be the default download for these systems. On both of
these systems, you should unpack this file to a suitable installation directory, and then follow the instructions 
in the README.html file. On Linux, you ,must build some on the binaries by executing the "ant" command
in the lejos_nxj/build directory.

New users should read the tutorial at http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/nxj/tutorial/.

Eclipse users should install the plugin from the update site - http:/lejos.sourceforge.net/tools/eclipse/plugin/nxj

Netbeans uses should look at the Netbeans page in the tutorial to see how to install the Netbeans plugin.

What is new in this release
---------------------------

It has been more than 18 months since the last release and a lot of development has happened. 

There is a new graphics startup menu that looks good and is easy to use.

The implementations of motors has changed a lot and is much improved. Motor.A, Motor.B and Motor.C
are now instances of a new NXTRegulatedMotor class, and there is a separate NXTMotor class for
applications that need to control motor power directly and not use speed regulation.

The LCD API has been simplified and cleaned up.

The support for standard java classes has been improved.

There have been lots of performance improvements, and internal redesigns to make things more robust.

There are lots more samples.

There is a new robotics package with lots of subpackages, such as navigation, localization, mapping, 
pathfinding, and objectdetection. The API has changed a lot in this area. Applications that use the Pilot
class should change to use DifferentialPilot, but there is also a LegacyPilot class that can be used to get going
quicker. There are now pilots for other types of vehicle, such as SteeringPilot and SegwayPilot.

Applications that used the SimpleNavigator class can change to use LegacyNavigator or use the new classes,
such as DifferentialPilot, NavPathController and OdometryPoseProvider. Look at the tutorial to get started
on this.

There is support for a lot more third party sensors. Some sensor classes have new names.

To understand the latest API, you should look at http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/nxj/api/, and for the PC API - 
http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/pc/api/.

There are new and improved tools particularly for remote debugging. For example look, at the new "console"
and "consoleviewer" targets in the ant build files in the samples and org.lejos.example projects,
or projects generated by the Netbeans plugin. These allow you to run a program on the NXT with output going
to the console or GUI console viewer. System.out and System.err output is directed to the console on the PC, 
and if exceptions occur they are decoded for you. In the case of consoleviewer, you also see a copy of your NXT 
screen display ob the PC, continously updated.

The Eclipse plug-in is greatly improved and should be more reliable and easier to install. It has a configuration
option to use both USB and Bluetooth, so you don't need to go to the preferences page to swap between these.
It has a very useful, file upload menu feature which allows any file in the IDE to be uploaded to the NXT.
We plan to update the plugin more frequently add add new tools to it.
