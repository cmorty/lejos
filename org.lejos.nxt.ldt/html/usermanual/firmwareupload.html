	<title>leJOS NXJ Eclipse Plug-In: Uploading the firmware</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Uploading the firmware</h1>
To run leJOS NXJ programs on the NXT brick, you need to upload the firmware that comes with the LEJOS NXJ to it. 
<br>Note: This has to be done only once.
<p>
<ol>
<li>To upload the firmware, first set your NXT brick to <b>reset mode</b> by pressing the reset button located in one of the 
plug holes on the bottom side of the brick. Once the brick is in reset mode, it will start clicking in a low pulse.</li>
<li>Now use the <em>leJOS NXJ->Upload Firmware</em> feature located in the menu bar of the Eclipse workbench to upload the firmware 
to the NXT brick. Once the upload is complete, an according message is displayed; the brick's LCD will show the leJOS logo.
The brick is ready now to receive and run leJOS NXJ programs.
</li>
</ol>
Note; if some error occurs, consult Eclipse's <b>Console</b> view for details.
