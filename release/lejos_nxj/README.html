<h1><a name="what_is_lejos">What is leJOS NXJ?</a></h1>
<p>leJOS (sometimes pronounced like the Spanish word "lejos" for "far") is a 
tiny Java-based operating system that has been ported to the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>LEGO Mindstorms NXT</li>
  <li>LEGO Mindstorms RCX</li>
  <li>Unix (for emulation of leJOS programs only)</li>
  </a>
</ul>
<p>leJOS was originally forked out of the </a><a
 href="http://tinyvm.sourceforge.net">TinyVM project</a>. 
It contains a VM for Java bytecodes and additional software to load and
run Java programs.</p>

These are some of the features offered:
<ul>
  <li>Object oriented language (Java)</li>
  <li>Preemptive threads (tasks)</li>
  <li>Arrays, including multi-dimensional ones</li>
  <li>Recursion</li>
  <li>Synchronization</li>
  <li>Exceptions</li>
  <li>Java types including float, double, long and String</li>
  <li>Math class</li>
  <li>Well-documented Robotics API</li>
</ul>

<p>leJOS NXJ is the version of leJOS for the LEGO Mindstorms NXT. 
It uses the same Java VM as the RCX version, but has new drivers for the NXT hardware.
</p>
<p>leJOS NXJ adds lots of new capability to leJOS including a file system, a menu system,
and support for I2C sensors, including those from third parties. The built-in tachometers in
the NXT motors have enabled much improved control over speed, steering and navigation.
</p>
<p>Bluetooth and USB communications are a great improvement over the infra-red link used by the RCX.</p>

<h1><a name="preliminiaries">Preliminaries</a></h1>
<ul>
  <li>You need a Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.5 or later.</li>
  <li>Your PATH must contain the JDK's bin directory.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have set JAVA_HOME properly to the root directory of the JDK (necessary if you use <em>ant</em>.</li>
  <li>On systems other than Microsoft Windows, you will need to build the distribution, so your PATH must
contain the ant binary (ant 1.7 or above).</li>
  <li>On Microsoft Windows and MAC OS X you will need the LEGO Mindstorms NXT software installed, as its USB drivers are used.</li>
  <li>On MAC OS X systems, you will need the OS X developer tools installed.</li>
</ul>


libusb must be installed on Linux and MAC OS X and can be obtained from <a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net">http://libusb.sourceforge.net</a>.<br/><br/>

On Linux systems, if you are running leJOS NXJ from a non-root user, you will need to ensure that you have read and write access the NXT USB device in /dev/bus/usb.
If you can identify the device in /dev/bus/usb, you can do this by:<br/><br/>

<em>sudo chmod a+w /dev/bus/usb/xxx/yyy</em><br/><br/>

However, the yyy number will count up each time the NXT is disconnected and reconnected.<br/><br/>

A better solution is to use udev rules or pamcomsole. How to do this varies with different Linux systems. A pamconsole solution that works on Fedora systems, is to create a file /etc/security/console.perms.d/60-libusb.perms with the two lines:<br/><br/>

<code>
&lt;usbdevices&gt;=/dev/bus/usb/*/*<br/>
&lt;console&gt; 0600 &lt;usbdevices&gt; 0644 root
</code>
<br/><br/>

To use udev rules, set up a file such as  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-lego.rules and populate it with the following lines: <br/><br/>

<code>
# Lego NXT<br/>
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="03eb", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660" <br/>
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0694", GROUP="lego", MODE="0660" <br/>
</code>
</br>

This relies on the username you are using being in the <em>lego</em> group. You can modify the file to your
requirements. The two vendors are LEGO and Atmel (for the samba driver used in firmware update mode).
You may need to restart udev.

<h1><a name="installation_and_set_up">Installation and Set Up</a></h1>

<ol>
  <li>Extract the files from the distribution. A lejos_nxj subdirectory will be created.</li>
  <li>Set the environment variable <em>NXJ_HOME</em> to the full path of the lejos_nxj
directory.</li>
  <li>Add the lejos_nxj/bin directory to your PATH.</li>
  <li>On Linux and Unix systems, depending on your privilege settings you might need to
adjust the execution permissions in the <em>bin</em> directory.</li>
</ol>
On Linux and Unix systems, you will have to build the distribution first. To do so,
switch to the <em>build</em> folder and run <code>ant</code>. You  will need to ensure that the
packages that leJOS NXJ is dependent on are on your system. These include libusb-dev,
gcj and libbluetooth-dev.

<h1><a name="using-lejos">Using leJOS NXJ</a></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Flash the leJOS NXJ firmware using <em>nxjflash</em>.</li>
  <li>Compile using <em>nxjc</em> instead of <em>javac</em>.</li>
  <li>Link, upload and run programs using <em>nxj</em>.</li>
  <li>Exceptions: Use <em>nxj --verbose</em> to get information on methods and special classes used by your program. Exceptions are shown on the NXT as Method:XXXX, CLASS:YY, where XXXX = method_signature and YY = exception_class_index</li>
</ul>

<p>Your NXT must be plugged into the USB, switched on, and in firmware update mode to run nxjflash. Note that the standard LEGO firmware will be overwritten and all existing data lost. You can reinstall the LEGO firmware using the LEGO Mindstorms software.
</p>
To go into firmware update mode press the reset button (at the back of the NXT , upper left corner) for more than 4 seconds. 
Your NXT will audibly tick when it is firmware update mode.
<br/><br/>

<p>To run nxjflash, open a command window, and type <em>nxjflash</em></p>

<p><em>nxjflash</em> will write the Java VM and the leJOS NXJ start-up menu to the flash memory of your NXT. It will create an empty user flash area. When the flash procedure has finished, leJOS NXJ will start up and an empty menu will be displayed.
</p>
<p>You can switch the NXT off at any time, including when a program is running, by pressing the orange and dark gray buttons (ENTER + ESCAPE) together.To switch it back on just press the orange button. The leJOS NXJ start-up menu will be displayed.
</p>

If your NXT freezes at any time, remove and re-insert a battery.

<h1><a name="compiling">Compiling and running your first code</a></h1>

To compile, link and download the Tune sample:

<ul>
  <li>Open a command window</li>
  <li>Check that java and lejos_nxj are on your PATH</li>
  <li>Check that the NXJ_HOME environment variable is defined</li>
  <li>Change to the projects\samples\Tune directory</li>
  <li>Type <em>nxjc Tune.java</em></li>
  <li>Check that your USB cable is connected</li>
  <li>Check that the NXT is turned on</li>
  <li>Type <em>nxj -r Tune</em></li>
 </ul>
 
<p>After a few seconds, you should hear an ascending tone sequence indicating that the program uploaded OK. You will then hear a tune play. When it has finished the leJOS NXJ menu will be displayed.</p>

<p>When you switch your NXT back on, select "Files" and press ENTER and you will see "Tune.nxj" in the files menu</p>

<p>You can navigate through the leJOS NXJ menus using the left and right buttons. You select a menu item by pressing ENTER, and exit from a menu by pressing ESCAPE. There are 3 menus: Files, Bluetooth ands System. To select a program, go to the Files menu, scroll down to your program and press the ENTER button. You will then see a sub-menu that lets you execute or delete the program.</p>

<h1><a name="tools">leJOS NXJ Tools</a></h1>
<p>The following tools are available with leJOS NXJ:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>nxjflash</em> - flashes the firmware and leJOS menu</li>
<li><em>nxjc</em> - compiles a Java program for leJOS NXJ</li>
<li><em>nxj</em> - links, uploads and optionally runs a leJOS NXJ program</li>
<li><em>nxjlink</em> - links a program</li>
<li><em>nxjupload</em> - uploads and optionally runs a program</li>
<li><em>nxjbrowse</em> - explorer for NXJ files</li>
<li><em>nxjflashg</em> - GUI version of nxjflash</li>
<li><em>nxjmonitor</em> - remote monitoring and tracing over Bluetooth</li>
<li><em>nxjconsole</em> - remote debugging over USB or Bluetooth</li>
<li><em>nxjconsoleviewer</em> - GUI version of nxjconsole</li>
<li><em>nxjdataviewer</em> - remote viewer for Datalogger files</li>
<li><em>nxjproxyserver</em> - proxy server for Socket and SocketServer connections</li>
</ul>

<p><em>nxj</em>, <em>nxjupload</em> and <em>nxjbrowse</em> can be used over Bluetooth or USB.
By default they try to use USB first, and if this fails, they try Bluetooth</P>

<p>Use the <em>--usb</em> flag to select usb only, or <em>--bluetooth</em> for Bluetooth only.</p>

<p><em>nxjbrowse</em> displays a list of all the NXTs that it finds, and allows you to select one to connect to. 
<em>nxj</em> and <em>nxjupload</em>, try each NXT they find in turn until they successfully connect to one. 
To pick a specific NXT to connect to by name, use the <em>--name</em> flag. In this release, 
--name works for both Bluetooth and USB.</p>

<p>You can connect to a specific NXT by address, using the <em>--address</em> flag. If you specify the address, a Bluetooth inquiry will not be done,
and the connection will be much faster. Use <em>nxjbrowse</em> to list the addresses of your NXT devices. An address is 12 hex digits with optional colons
between the hex pairs.</p>

<p>The leJOS NXJ tools can use different comms driver to connect to the NXT. The default driver for USB on Windows is NXTCommFantom which uses the LEGO fantom API
and on other systems is NXTCommLibnxt, which uses David Anderson's libnxt library and the libusb open source library.  
At this release, all systems use NXTCommBluecove as the Bluetooth comms driver. This uses libraries from the Bluecove open source project.</p>

<p>The properties file, lejos_nxt/bin/nxj.properties, can be modified to select different comms drivers.</p>

<p><em>nxjbrowse</em> lists the files on the NXT and includes their size, and start and end pages. 
It can be used to delete, upload and download programs and other files. 
It can also run programs, change the name of the NXT and defrag the files,
moving them all to the start of user flash memory.</p> 

<p><em>nxjmonitor</em> can be used to monitor a running program on the NXT. 
The program being monitored should run the LCPBTResponder thread and can output trace
messages using LCP.messageWrite on message box 0 - see the MonitorTest sample.
<em>nxjmonitor</em> produces a graphical display of the current values of sensors, the battery and motor tachometers
as the program runs, as well as displaying the trace messages.</p>

<p><em>nxjconsole</em> displays messages output by the RConsole class on the NXT.
One way to use RConsole is to include a call to RConsole.openUSB(0) at the
start of your leJOS program, and RConsole.close() at the end. A stream such as stderr can then
be redirected to the remote console by <em>System.setErr(new PrintStream(RConsole.openOutputStream()));</em>.
openBluetooth(0) can be used instead of openUSB(0). </p>

<p><em>nxjconsoleviewer</em> is a GUI version of nxjconsole</p> 

<p><em>nxjdataviewer</em> views data log file produced by the Datalogger class - see the DLTest sample.<p>

<p><em>nxjproxyserver</em> runs a proxy server that can be used to support Socket and SocketServer connections between
programs running on the NXT and Java programs on a PC or across the Internet - see the SocketTest, SocketServer and TimeTest samples.<p>

<h1><a name="debugmonitor">Using the debug monitor</a></h1>
<p>At this release it is possible to include a debug monitor thread 
as part of the uploaded binary by specifying the --debug option
on <em>nxj</em> or <em>nxjlink</em>.</p>
<p>The debug monitor is the start of a more fully featured remote debugging
capability that will be added in a future release. The debug monitor gives
a more details when an untrapped exception occurs including simple stack trace 
that shows methods called by method number, and allows you to interrupt a running program by pressing ENTER+ESCAPE.<p>
<p>When an interrupt occurs a thread dump is displayed. It lists the threads
in you program in reverse order of priority. The thread number, state and the numbers of the last 3 executed
methods is displayed for each thread. The thread states are:-</p>
R - the thread is runnable<br/>
S - the thread is sleeping<br/>
D - the thread is dead<br/>
N - the thread is new (not yet started)<br/>
I - the thread has been started but not yet run<br/>
E - the thread is waiting for a synchronized section<br/>
W - the thread is waiiting on a monitor object<br/>
* this is the running thread (not the debug thread)<br/>
<p>After a user interrupt or exception, ENTER+ESCAPE shuts down the brick, ESCAPE terminates the user
program and restarts the menu. Any other key continues the user program.</p>
 
<h1><a name="limitations">Known limitations</a></h1>
Due to size constraints, some Java language
features have been omitted. Others just haven't been implemented yet.
Known limitations with all versions of leJOS are: </a>
<ul>
  <li>The instanceof operation will always be true for interfaces. In
bytecode, CHECKCAST succeeds on all interface classes (which is a bit
unsafe)</li>
  <li>The instanceof and checkcast operations are rejected by the
linker when they are performed on array classes (e.g. b instanceof
byte[])</li>
  <li>There are no objects of type java.lang.Class, which means that
the ".class" construct won't work. Class.forName() throws
ClassNotFoundException at all times. As a consequence, reflection is
not supported by leJOS</li>
  <li>Most JDK APIs are unavailable</li>
  </a>
</ul>
<h1><a name="bugs">Known Bugs</a></h1>
<p>The following bugs apply to all versions of leJOS:</p>
<ul>
 <li>MONITOREXIT ignores null objects (it assumes
MONITORENTER has handled them). Furthermore, it doesn't check monitor
validity. Until this bug is fixed (actually, at all times) all monitors
should be constants</li>
  <li>Initializers (static or otherwise) are not implicitly
synchronized. This could lead to access of statics before they are
initialized, when multiple threads use a class</li>
  </a>
</ul>
<h1><a name="nxjbugs">Known Bugs and Limitations in leJOS NXJ</a></h1>
<p>The following bugs and limitations apply to the current version of leJOS NXJ:</p>

<ul>
<li>Occasionally, after flashing the firmware with with nxjflash, the battery level shows as empty (0,0) and buttons do not respond. If this happens, a battery must be removed and re-inserted. It is not necessary to repeat the nxjflash.
</li>
<li>It is a good idea to restart the brick after flashing leJOS. If not problems with motors can occur.</li>
<li>Occasionally, after pressing the orange (ENTER) button to start leJOS NXJ, the LCD remains blank. If this occurs, and is not due to low batteries, it is necessary to shut down leJOS, by pressing the orange and dark gray buttons (ENTER + ESCAPE), and try again.
</li>
<li>Only one file can be open at a time.
</li>
<li>leJOS NXJ only supports program upload and download, tools such as nxjbrowse, and LEGO communications Protocol commands when the start-up menu is running, not when a user program is running, unless a user program explicitly starts the LCPBTResponder thread.
</li>
<li>The number of files that can be uploaded to lejos NXJ is limited by the fact that the whole file table must fit into two 256-byte pages. If the average filename length is 15 characters, approximately 20 files are supported.
</li>
<li>The maximum filename length is 20 characters.
</li>
<li>Not all LEGO Communications Protocol command are supported, and the semantics of some of them are different from that of the standard LEGO firmware. In particular only one file can be open at a time and the file handle is always 0.
</li>
<li>Support for sound sample files is limited to 8-bit WAV files.
</li>
<li>Data aborts occur if there is a failure in the NXJ VM. If a data abort occurs, it is necessary to remove and re-insert a battery.
</li>
<li>On Windows, using the Bluecove library, NXTs that have been paired with the PC are in the list of available NXTs, even when they are not switched on. This does not happen with Bluez on Linux.
</li>
<li>Is usually necessary to pair your NXT using the Operating System before it can be connected to by the leJOS NXJ PC tools and libraries.
</li>
<li>Discovery of Bluetooth devices is slow, taking at least 10 seconds. It is slower still with Bluez on Linux. For Java streams connections from user programs, you can connect directly by Bluetooth address, which is much faster.
</li>
</ul>
