					<h4>Installing Eclipse</h4>
					<p>
					You can download Eclipse from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse downloads</a>.
					If you are only going to use Eclipse for leJOS NXJ programs, you will only need standard Java development capabilities - 
					you will not need a version that supports the Java Enterprise Edition or other languages such as C++ or Eclipse plugin development.
					A package such as "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is sufficient for leJOS NXJ. Make sure you download a package for your operating system. The examples in this
					section are for Microsoft Windows, but the installation process is similar for other operating systems.
					</p>
					<p>Unzip the package you downloaded to a folder. If you extract all files to C:\ then your Eclipse folder will be C:\eclipse.</p>
					<p> You can start Eclipse by running eclipse.exe from your Eclipse folder. You may want to put a shortcut to eclipse.exe on your desktop.</p>
					<p> When you first start Eclipse, you are asked to select a workspace:</p>
					<img src="eclipseworkspace.jpg"/>
					<p>You can leave this as the default, or you can work with multiple workspaces and create one just for your leJOS projects.</p>
					
					<p> When you click OK, the IDE will open and you will see a welcome screen. You can close the Welcome window and start developing leJOS programs.</p>

					<h4>Importing the leJOS NXJ projects into Eclipse</h4>
					
					<p> You first need to import the leJOS projects into your Eclipse workspace. 
					The easiest way to do this is to select File > Import... and then choose General > Existing Projects into Workspace. 
					Browse to the folder where you installed the leJOS projects (e.g. C:\Users\Me\leJOSNXJProjects or 
					C:\Documents and Settings\Me\leJOSNXJSettings), and select them all to import.</p>
					
					<p>Note that if you import the leJOS NXJ projects this way, the source does not get moved to the workspace,
					but stays in leJOSNXJProjects. It is probably a better idea to copy your projects from leJOSNXJProjects
					into the Eclipse workspace and then import them by selecting the Eclipse workspace as the source folder. That way you
					have always got a clean copy of the leJOS NXJ projects and the Eclipse versions will not be uninstalled when you install a new version of leJOS.</p>

					<a name="3"></a>
					<h4>Using the samples project</h4>

					<p> You should then see several projects  in your Package Explorer window including samples. 
					Try exploring the samples project. You can open up folders by clicking on the expand/collapse toggles next 
					to the folder name, and you can open files by double-clicking on file names. 
					Try expanding the "BlueStats" folder, and its "default package" folder and opening BlueStats.java. 
					You should see:</p>
					
					<img src="eclipsesamples.jpg"/>
					
					<p> There is a source folder within the samples project for each sample. 
					Each folder contains a build.xml file which is a build file for the sample written using "ant". 
					Ant is a build system specially designed for Java - it comes bundled with Eclipse.</p>
					<p> There are other ways of building, uploading and running leJOS NXJ programs, 
					such as using the leJOS Eclipse plugin, but the ant build files are easy to use, so we will start with them.
					<p> Ant build files have different "targets". The default target for the sample build.xml files is "uploadandrun". 
					This means that if you run the build.xml file it will compile the Java source, 
					link it with the standard leJOS classes (classes.jar) to produce a binary file and then upload ad run the binary file.</p>
					<p>Turn on your NXT, make sure it is connected by USB or can be connected to via Bluetooth.  
					Then right-click on the build.xml and select "Run As" and "Ant Build":</p>
					
					<img src="eclipsebuild.jpg"/>
					
					<p> You should see output like the following in the Console window:</p>
					
					<pre><font size=-2">

</font></pre>
					<p> This verbose output from the leJOS linker tells you all the classes and methods that have been included in your program. It is very useful for debugging your programs.</p>  
					<p> You should see the Bluetooth statistics on your NXT LCD screen. You can stop the BlueStats program by pressing ESC on the NXT.</p>
					<p> You can browse through the samples and try them out. Some of the samples need to communicate with a program on the PC - see "Using the PC samples project" below. 
					Other samples need specific sensors attached to the NXT or a robot with specific characteristics - such as a steerable wheeled vehicle. 
					See the comments at the start of each of the Java files to understand the requirements of the sample.</p>
					<p>Note that the samples project uses default package names for simplicity. This is not good practice for Java programming so when
					we create our own project, we will use a proper package name.</p>
					<p>Note also that the samples project contains multiple programs each with a main method. This is convenient for showing lots
					of examples of leJOS NXJ programming in one project, but is not best practice. When we create our own projects, we will have a separate Eclipse project for each leJOS NXJ program</p>

					<h4>Using the PC samples project</h4>
					<p>If you imported all the leJOS NXJ projects into your workspace, you should have a pcsamples project. 
					Open it up and look at one of the samples such as BTSend. </p>
					
					<p>BTSend works with the BTREceive sample. BTSend.java runs on the PC and BTReceive.java runs on the NXT.</p>
					
					<p> There are no build files for the PC samples as they are not necessary. Try running
					BTSend.java by right-clicking on it and selecting, "Run as Java application". In the console output, you will see 
					a message saying that BTSEnd needs two parameters; the name and Bluetooth address of the NXT</p>
					
					<p>The easiest way of getting these values is to upload BTReceive to the NXT, as we need to do that anyway. </p>
					
					<p>Go to the samples application, select the build.xml file for BTReceive, and run the
					build file to upload BTReceive to the NXT. As part of the console output, you will see the name and
					address of the NXT. Copy these to the clipboard.</p>
					
					<p> Now go to "Run Configurations" on the "Run" menu. Select the Java Application configuration 
				    for BTSend. (This was created when you tried to run it before). Paste the NXT name and address as the arguments
				    and click "Run".</p>
				    
				    <p> BTSend should now run and connect to BTReceive, send it 100 integers and display the values it gets back. 
				    BTReceive will then wait for another connection.</p>
				    
				    <p>You can look through the other PC sample and try them out in a similar way. 
				    Most of them are paired with NXT samples. Look at the comment at the start of the Java files.</p>

					<h4>Creating your own project</h4>
					<p> To create a project, select File > New > Java Project. Give the project a name, e.g. "myproject" and press Finish to accept all the defaults.</p>
					<p> You should now see "myproject" in the Package Explorer.</p>
					<p> You will need to add classes.jar to your project. To do this right-click on "myproject", select "Properties" and then "Java Build Path".
					Then select Libraries and then "Add external Jar". Browse for classes.jar in your NXJ installation and select it. Then go to the "Order and Export" tab and move classes.jar up so that it is above JRE System Library.
					You will  now see classes.jar under "Referenced Libraries" in myproject.</p>
					<p> You should use a package name for your project. We will call our project "org.me.myproject". </p>
					<p>Select the "src" folder in myproject, right-click on it and select New > Package
					   and type your package name.</p>
					<p> We now want to create main class.To do this, select the package you have just created, right-click on it and
					select New > Class. Type in the class name - we will use "HelloWorld". Select the "public static void main(String[] args)" option.
					
					You should now have a HelloWorld.java program containing:</p>
					
					<div class="CodeBox">
					<code><pre>
package org.me.mypackage;

public class HelloWorld {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }
}
				    </pre></code>
				    </div>
				    
				    <p>Edit the source so it reads:</p>
				    
				    <div class="CodeBox">
				    <code><pre>
package org.me.mypackage;

import lejos.nxt.*;

public class HelloWorld {

    /**
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        Button.waitForPress();
    }
}
				    </pre></code>
				    </div>
				    
				    <p> You will now need to build your project. One way to do this is to use an ant build file in the same way that the samples do.
				    To do this, select a build.xml file from one of the samples, right-click on it and select "Copy". Then go to org.me.mypackage, right-click on it and select "Paste".</p>
				    <p>Double-click on build.xml to edit it and change the name and description attributes. Then change the line that reads:</p>
				    <p>&lt;basename property="program" file="."/&gt;</p>			    
				    <p>to</p> 
				    <p>&lt;property name="program" value="HelloWorld"&gt;</p>			    
				    <p>and add a new property:</p>
				   
                    <p>&lt;property name="class" value="org.me.myproject.HelloWorld"&gt;</p>

				    <p>Then, in the link target, change the line that reads:</p>
				    <p>&lt;arg value="${program}"/&gt;</p>
				    <p>to </p>
				    <p>&lt;arg value="${class}"/&gt;</p>
				    <p>Finally copy the "sample.properties" file from the sample project into your project as this defines 
				    the locations of the jar files used by the samples. 
				    You are then ready to upload and run your first leJOS NXJ project.
				    This is done in the same way as for the samples: by right-clicking on the build.xml file and selecting "Ant Build". 
				    Make sure your NXT is switched on.</p>
				    <p>You should the verbose linker output in the Console window, and your program should be uploaded to the NXT and run. 
				    You should see "Hello World" on the NXT LCD screen. 
				    Press any key on the NXT to stop the program.</p>

					<h4>Setting up the leJOS GUI Tools</h4>
					<p> leJOS NXJ comes with a set of GUI tools that can be using for flashing the firmware, exploring files on the NXT,
					    monitoring and debugging programs on the NXT, downloading data logs, etc. 
					    It is useful to be able to run these tools within Eclipse, and to do this you need to set them up as external tools.</p>
					<p> To create external tools click on the down array next to the Run External Tools Icon on the toolbar and select "Extenal Tools Configuration":</p>
					<img src="eclipseexternal.jpg"/>
					<p> Then select Program and click on the New Launch Configuration button and you should see:</p>
					<img src="eclipseconfiguration.jpg"/>
					<p> Type the name of your configuration, such as NXJ Flash and click on Browse File System and find the bin directory
					of where you installed leJOS NXJ and select nxjflash.bat.</p>
					If you have multiple installations of leJOS you can go to the Environment tab and set NXJ_HOME to the one you wish to use.</p>
					 
					<p>Other GUI tools you should set up include:</p>
					<ul class="BlueArrows">
						<li>nxjbrowse - an Explorer for NXJ files</li>
						<li>nxjconsoleviewer - GUI viewer for RConsole debug output</li>
						<li>nxjmonitor - Remote monitoring of programs running on the NXT</li>
						<li>nxjdataviewer - GUI tool to download data logs from NXT</li>
					</ul></p>
					
					<p>You may also want to set up command line tools such as:</p>
					<ul class="BlueArrows">
						<li>nxjflash - command line firmware flash tool</li>
						<li>nxjconsole - command line viewer for RConsole debugging output</li>
						<li>nxjsocketproxy - proxy for communicating with PC and Internet program using sockets</li>
					</ul></p>
